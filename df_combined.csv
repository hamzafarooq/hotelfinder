everything we needed for an enjoyable relaxing stay including tea and coffee downstairs which weabsolutely beautiful house that gives you a true new york experience our lily room was gorgeous and james was really helpful for recommending local hotspots and how to navigate new york the house is near the subway so you can easily get to and from allbeautiful and tastefully decorated guest house in the heart of harlem very friendly owner who was available whenever a question needed answering but not invasive and locals always friendly plenty of eating establishments nearby and a great base for tramy mother and i stayed here in june from the 14th17th we stayed in the calliope room and we were relieved at how accurate the pictures online were we were instantly impressed by how warm and welcoming james was to us from the first time we stepped outlovely property and hosts very easily accessible to midtown manhattan on the subway  can get to 59th street on an express train in under 10 mins would recommend  area is very safe so please do not be concerned about staying in harlemi felt like i was at home during my stay here the room was spacious clean and in a quiet neighborhood short walk to local and express subways 30 minutes or less to time square bus routes and near bars and restaurants though most of our time was spjames is a great friendly host the property is located in a very quiet side street in harlem we loved the area our experience is it was very safe we never felt unsafe day or night either walking from the subway or on the subway itselfthere is somewe stayed for a week at 255west guesthouse and it could have not been better very warm welcome great room enough space nice hosts good location just amazing we had a great time in new york thank youi had never been to nyc before and was traveling out to see my second cousin who lives in harlem the neighborhood doesnt offer too many options in terms of lodging and i was a little skeptical of going through airbnb as you dont exactly know what youi liked the location a lot it was easy to get downtown by subway and a half hour casual walk to the top of central park the hotel is very special much thought and detail is apparent in the renovation of this lovely old place so quiet too thank you jif you want to feel at home and not just a visitor this is the place to stay when in ny my guestroom was large and very comfortable it faced the street and there were no issues with noise the attention to detail from the decor to the french press cofthe guesthouse was centrally located in harlem we were travelling with another couple so had a room each with private facilities and shared the private kitchen on the 3rd floor the bedrooms  facilities were clean  comfortable the kitchen was v dirtstayed a week with friends and shared the third floor rooms with the adjoining kitchen room was ok but the air conditioner didnt really cool the room well enough however what spoilt the stay was the filthy condition of the kitchen it was great beivery nice experience we spent 3 nights in calliope room on 2nd floor room was clean nicely decorated and perfect for our needs nice change from hotel vibe had a small refrigerator james the owner was available and responsive to uswould stay againthis place was a really fun place to stay i booked the lily room and enjoyed everything especially the awesome shower it was clean comfortable and a short walk to where i needed to go for work i would book againstaying in the 255 west guesthouse brownstone while visiting new york was like a dream come true the decor was lovely and james was a gracious host i was attending a reading institute at columbia teachers college and it was a pleasant 25 minute walk toi really appreciated my stay at 255west  yes its not close to the sights so perhaps not the ideal location if you are in new york for the first time and focusing on sightseeing however for your next stay and all others after that  especially once yi was in love from the moment i stepped into the property from the aesthetics with decor the structural design of the property and even more so with the privacy of my booked room and nearby bath both of which has the amenity of locking my room was tthis renovated harlem brownstone was a beautiful space lots of care went into the property inn owner was friendly reliable and fleixible price was more than affordable only drawback was that we had planned on spending a lot of time in manhattan andi loved staying here spacious comfortable room nice big bed great tv options and lovely hostsgreat area too easy to get to and plenty to eat locally the availability of tea and coffee in the lobby area was very kind and there are many thoughtful toufrank was a great host very informative the rooms were rooms beautiful cannot complain about a single thing large screen tv good coffee making facilities clean and tidy bathrooms beds extremely comfortable slept like a baby supermarket just up the road pstayed for four nights hosts charming  room lovely and much bigger than the chains a bit further in fast wifi in the rooms with tea and coffee in the lounge area if you have a look at the zip code and see harlem  dont worry it is perfectly safe andthis guesthouse is perfekt for families single travelers and couples the beds are very comfortable very nice bathroom and the interior is amazing very quiet you have a 510 min walk to both the blue and the red subway and approx 1520 min ride to tiwe stayed here for 3 nights during our stay in new york the place is would seem far from downtown but its merely 25 minutes away by subway the queen room we chose was very nicely decorated with a beautiful bathroom with bathtub the owners are very wewe stayed 4 days the room was very nice and clean the bathroom big and confortable the location is strategic since it is very close to 45 metro strations and 2 stops away from time square with the express lines only one lack the small stairs upas soon as frank opened the door to welcome us we knew we made the right choice when he took us up the one flight of stairs to our room and opened the door it was exactly as it looked in the pictures we stayed in the gino room and its very spaciousi visited nyc last june so i should have got around to writing this earlier sorry frank while its true that staying in harlem would not be as central as some would like consider that you will get to see a side of nyc that you might otherwise have ovwhen we got off the subway i was intimidated by the neighborhood its rough on the edges we got used to it to some degree and never truly felt in danger we found a great restaurant as well as a cafe hyacinths haven  double dutch brothers coffeewe absolutely loved it here the house is so beautifully designed the location is perfect close to the train and shops but tucked away on a quiet street thank you so much for making us feel at home frank and james are wonderful hosts and we cant waithe gino room was just like the picture the finishes in the room are very nice and the room was clean they provide coffee and tea in the morning with togo cups if you need it easy to get to the trains we would stay againthis is a wonderful little place off the beaten path that had the feeling of home the space was quiet immaculate and cozy the pictures dont do it justice you will feel at ease here the rooms are as pictured both modern and classic at the same timi was in new york for job interviews and had the opportunity to stay at 255wesr guesthouse the room was decorated in a lovely way and was very clean i would highly recommend staying here it is locating near a subway station and so it is easy to get da lovely place to stay the hosts frank and james are very accommodating and provided us with local info when we arrived other than that they stayed out of the way but were available via phone or a knock on their door on our departure day we had a latwe have just completed a fabulous week at 255w 132nd st frank and james are welcoming but unobtrusive hosts who provide the most wonderful place to stay as other reviewers have noted dont be put off by the past reputation of the area it is not intimmy accommodation search was lengthy i put real work into finding the perfect cost effective location and this spot gets a total 1010 thumbs up you cant fault the facilities or

definiteexcellent location for downtown and wall street comfortable  spacious and very clean room with good facilities  although a coffee machine would be nicebreakfast is functional but not very inspiring but probably works well for the business clientelewe came from nj by ferry and the hotels proximity to pier 11 was key con ed noise on street at 130am was pretty bad on our first night second night was great nice to have a fridge with complimentary drinks and snacks would appreciate inroom coffamazing hotel in the wall street district gorgeous room and bathroom with a separate bathtub and toilet and rainfall shower bed was very comfortable and surprisingly located in a quiet area of nyc i didnt hear much traffic noise at nighttime niceive stayed at a few different boutiquey hotels in ny and the rooms here were much more spacious the rooms were that of a higherend hotel  comfortable king bed remote blackout curtains free nonalcoholic drinks from the mini bar rain shower  buroom was spacious and clean i loved the hardwood floorsno carpet with creepy things crawling underneath close to the wedding venuewe walked there and to several eating establishments highly recommend kyle was very nicecat check ini stay here quite often and the staff at andaz always makes sure my stay is perfect they know which rooms i like and they are always very attentiverecently they have completed a refresh of the rooms this included new wallcovering furnishings and carpcheck in was nice and easy probably the quickest ive ever experienced the room was nice but no art on the walls so it felt empty bathroom was nice and clean the pillows are awful they fell flatwe attended a wedding in downtown manhattan i have always stayed in mid town when we visited ny it was an eye opener to stay downtown we enjoyed the atmosphere downtown and would consider staying at the andaz the next time we visitaaron and lazlo provided outstanding service  especially during my birthday luncheon they provided excellent meal suggestions and even kept the restaurant open for us until the last guests left at 3 pm the rooms are very modern and quite large the vinice hotel in a good spot some rooms are a little more updated than others but rooms are very big considering its new york city i hate the fact that they add this 30 destination fee per day which although it gives you a 10 credit per day to use ieven in the craziness of nyc this place is quiet and comfortingthe hospitality of the staff is awesome the food is delicious and the room service is prompt we stay here every april and december and love it each timewe stayed at the andaz last week for our trip to new york and everything was absolutely amazing check in was extremely quick and simple the staff were always so friendly regardless of if we were just walking through reception or if we actually had a quwe were very disappointed with the hotel the front desk personnel were not friendly and generally acted like they didnt care whether we were there the suite we had was very dark and not well lit it had no drawers for clothes storage and basically onewe stayed in the andaz for the 5boro bike ride and were initially pleased with the hotel roomit was spacious comfy and in a great location to reach the staten island ferry when we first walked in the laminated wood floor felt springyspongy but wheads up the restaurant is not open on sundays i came in on a sunday for several days of meetings  the restaurant was closed as are many places in the area the hotel is lovely the rooms are spacious  but a little dark lots of extras like coffee awe stayed at the andaz for 5 nights commencing april 23 rd the hotel is comfortable  and modern  and wall st is a great location to be based  rooms are large by nycstandards and well designed  staff are friendly and efficient and very helpful with anthe rooms were large clean and included free water juice and snacks the room service was quick and the food was delicious every staff person i interacted with was very friendly and helpful like at disney this included checkin room service orderi had some nice experience with the hotel previously and today i have to stay here again to attend to some personal business in nyc what a delightful surprise to receive a newly renovated room which was very beautifully and smartly designed the staffthey had very dirty carpets on the 7th floor by the elevators and the hallway baseboards were chipped and scuffed the service person often forgot to replace items in the room like the bathmat a water glass and once forgot to empty the bathroom trash cspacious modern wellappointed rooms with convenient location to wall st good customer service with restaurant which is just right for those there for business or vacation would definitely recommend to others and stay there againthe location is the best its a 3 minutes walking distance to my office that is located in wall street there are a lot of restaurants the room is clean and the space is okay too things to improve though is the bed comforter and the pillowsplease,the andaz wall street was the perfect hotel for a girls weekend getaway the rooms were huge beds comfortable lovely shower and all the amenities were perfect it felt like the hotel staff had thought of everything we felt totally pampered throughoutbeautiful hotel first room smelled like cigarette smoke but was quickly given another room and many apologies free wine and cookies an unexpected pleasure.

show and a one night stay at the carvi hotel a day and half before check in my wife had a stomach virusunderstanding they have a cancellation policy i wanted to ask if the hotel would agrthough a very small hotel i like it for its cleanliness and quiet the corridor on my floor is only wide enough for a large size luggage i hardly heard any noise from the other occupants on my floor the exception being the loud talking of a few guestsstayed 5 nights at the carvi hotel small but that is why we booked itgood location in midtown near a few tube stationsrooms were clean and had everything we needed the only small gripe was how little cupboard space there waswe were 2 adults and 2 tbooked this hotel because of location we had a window in our room which some people said they did not the room was a little small but was perfect for staying for one night everything was clean and worked out great for usthis hotel was great value for the money yes the room was small but that is common in nyc the room however was tastefully decorated with comfortable bed reading light minibarfridge safe desk tveverything youd expect in a nice hotel wasthis is a very decent hotel for the price and location but not the ritz service was fast and friendly we had one minor problem in our room and someone was there to address it within 5 minutes we stayed in a room with two double beds those all roomsthis hotel is right in the center of nyc which makes it easy to move around most attractions are simply a walk away even with my 8 year old we didnt struggle to walk to central park times square empire state building etc its a small well keptthe bed is so great the pillows and blankets are so soft the location is also good near the metro and near restaurants the cleaning was very good you also get free coffee the shower is a bit small but it was okay minibar is expensivemy wife and i had to travel to nyc between christmas and new years because of a death in the family and because of housing issues we ended up staying at the carvi on two separate occasions the first time for one night and the second for two nights bothave been here this week stayed with a friend the bed is a decent one shower quite good even though annoying that the shower head can not be taken off the hook but water temperature was excellent weve had an interior room with no window so it wgreat place to stay clean centric very cozy if you go to the terrace on the 7th floor the most important thing to me was how friendly and clean the hotel was they offer robes towels  shampoo and even brown towels for some women who use heavy makethis hotel was just ok nothing really outstanding i did love how clean it was and the clean comfortable bed but that was it unfortunately the hotel room is super tiny not meant for more than a person or two the walls are super thin making it almost iwe really enjoyed staying at this hotel stayed as a couple just before christmas for a week excellent location very clean bigger than usual nyc size rooms and lovely staff i accidently left behind something and the staff found it a few days afteri visited the carvi hotel on the 51216 for a week the hotel is quite small but located midtown so near all the main tourist attractions the room was nice and spacious and cleaned daily with a flat screen tv the staff were very helpful recommending ra great hotel at a great location the staff is incredibly nice and helpful i rekommenderande you ask for a quiet room in short its a great quiet hotel with great staff i truly recommend this hotelstayed a night for business purposes good beds and service and all important things are fine hotel has no breakfast bar or other areas for hanging out but this is not important as it is close to everything it is by close to 5th and central park andthe location of the hotel is great5 minutes walk to the subway across the road you can have a descent breakfast about 15the receptionists are very helpful and friendlythe rooms are quiet small but the bed is very comfortablejust checked out of carvi hotel a small but lovely hotel situated right in the city of new york with good walking distance to both central park and time square friendly staff and nice clean roomswill definitely book here again next time were in nycthe receptionist was very friendly and helpful check in was a breeze room was very small but clean with all the necessary amenities bed was comfortable and room was quiet there were no windows in the room where i stayed subway is close by not fathe carvi gave us everything we needed from our hotel clean and modern good location friendly staffour room was internal with no windows this was great in terms of noise there was none and ensuring we slept easily when we needed to not quite sostayed for 2 nights mid week as we were attending a conference at the javits centre we had a king room with no window and this was perfect for us no window was not a deal as we were out most of the time the staff were great helpful and very friendlan excellent small hotel with clean and well appointed rooms no restaurant or food service but there are restaurants all around the only negative is the typical ny city noise outside the building at all hours so much more reasonable than the majoritymost of new yorks landmarks such as time square broadway central park fifth ave are within 1015 minutes walking distance there are at least two subway stations within 5 min walking distance if you are a film buff locations for breakfast at tiffanstayed at the carvi for 4 night beginning of december rooms are clean and well furnished as with all new york hotels they are compact but are a great base for exploring reception very helpful location is around 15 minutes from central park and 25 minthe hotel is excellently located being close to lexington avenue on 55th street it is within easy walking distance of central park rockefeller centre and central station the nearby subway station is easily accessible from jfk and offers good links toi stayed here on business and found it adequate i particularly liked the in room coffee maker and 2 decent sized windows bed is a bit hard and the room is typically small for nyc  a bit on the expensive side,Hotel carvi on east 55th st is a great place to stay for a few days while visiting nyc situated within walking distance of many of the midtown sights including grand central times square rockafella centre central park and the shops of 5th avenue stagood location pleasant and helpful staff very cozy and not noisy room.
Cassa Hotel Times Square,my overall experience here was phenomenal my room was very neat and clean additionally id like to give recognition to jessica at the front desk very professional very helpful and informative articulate and genuinely very kind she made it her busno interest to stay there arrogant staff small room noisy dirty they charge you around 50 dollarsday for the cleaning incredible

names to mention diana ronald ashely luz and jessica i even met the owner fred thank you cassawe stayed at this lovely place in august we cant to new york for a secret wedding of a very good friend we choose this hotel as it is not too big and had a roof to terrace the reception area is small and can seem bussly but we were dealt with veryhotel is basic clean and has a nice terrace breakfast is ok pictures shown do not match the hotel you expect to find but its still ok just a bit overpriced in my honest opinion staff is friendly and always willing to supportthe photos are not what you get when you arrive at the hotel nor are the services which you pay for 5hrs after checking in having flown in from overseas wanting to have a hot shower being 10 degrees outside there was no hot water in our room upon ricesar and lucy were the best they made our experience so much better their service was amazing they make us feel so welcome we came to celebrate our birthday and they made this experience so much better thank you so much for the attention and giving usthis was a great value for the location i needed to be in nice staff small rooms but thats expected when visiting nyc or other large cities the room was clean the refrigerator wasnt very cold the rooms are quite so you dont hear much next door orpositives bed and pillows were comfortable roof garden is beautiful convenient location if youre seeing a broadway show negatives the first room we were assigned smelled like fresh paint so we had to move quality of the breakfast buffet was disapp we had a great time at cassa hotel the room was very large and the bed was amazing and comfortable on our departure day we had great assistance from michael and luz who gave us a late checkout so we could enjoy our last few hours in new york to thei recently celebrated 4 years together with my special lady and wanted to go to the city where we had our first date i wanted to stay in the city since it was going to be a late night and cassa did not disappoint they were so accommodating and the gm frewe stayed at the casa the night of our kids free date night we were catching a concert at msg and wanted to stay at a prime location between food and msg that was affordable the staff was friendly and great to give us points of where to eat the room wthis is a disaster for a hotel and is taking advantage of the name cassa the real one is on 45thnot 39 and 9th ave this place is dirty and the lobby is a closet theres a 50 resort fee that is for junk ritz crackers cheese and cereal for breakfhotel is located to time square and very nice area hotel room was very clean and well maintain staff and room service was very nice and helpful breakfast was awesome my son loves the hotel and the ambiancedirty walls and the hallway carpet is downright filthy i can hear every word from my neighbors room i cant wait to check out of this dump i dont know if this is really a legit hotel rather than an office building in disguise take a pass on thistayed here in december 2018 and had an amazing time walking distance to times square and many other key sights two of the reception staff were extremely friendly and the breakfast was decent as well would definitely recommend this place to othersamazing atmosphere i really enjoyed the free bar in wine manuel was an excellent bartender the eggs and croissants at the breakfast were also very nice the location is great near subway and times squaregreat location of the hotel and accessibility to the time square the hotel staff took a great care of our employees i would especially highlight servis from manuel during happy hours thank you cassa hotelgreat hotel near times square new york is a really nice city great service and a big thanks to manuel for making it the experience at cassa hotel even better i would highly recommend this to everyone going to new yorkhorrible experience i dont even know how to startthey sell the hotel as  luxury hotel but once you get

and run down bathroom shower full of mold and mildew no guest access to ice robes thins and dirtyfurniture stained and worn out limited television stationswill never be backgo at your own rii thought i was booking cassa 45 but the site i clicked on was cassa times square and boy was i disappointed when i found out where i had booked a room this hotel is located in one of the noisiest dirtiest spots in nyc right between port authority bfirst let me say hands down the service was impeccable the overnight crew micheal front desk was amazzzzing very intentive charming  catering to our needs he went above and beyond to make sure that myself  my girlfriends received full new york ci will be staying at cassa every time im in the city from now on as a frequent nyc visitor i have stayed in many many hotels all over the city and this was by far the best experience ive ever had my bestie and i stayed for 3 days2 nights for a gihotel location was perfect  the service of the hotel personal was outstanding cesar and diana give us an outstanding service all the time the hotel facilities were very clean and the room service personal was very amiablesatisfied senior couple from finlandreally good location in the heart of new york city close to everythingbreakfast was good enoughstaff was kind and helpfulspecial thanks to manuel he gave us several good tips where to go and made us feel at homei booked cassa hotel because they were a certificate of excellence in 2016 the location was close to the theatre district but that was the only plus to the hotel the rooms are strangely laid out our first room was old and worn so they were kind enoughjessica worked the desk from checkin to checkout two days later she was friendly and helpful and made sure we had a ride to the airport augustine the housekeeping manager also went above and beyond to introduce himself and ask if we needed anythingthe service of cassa hotel times square was fantastic jessica the receptionist was amazingkind accommodating and incredibly helpful answering all and any questions in addition to her service the rest of the staff was also incredible and the hhafter checking out the hotel they deducted the deposit money plus 250 called them latter they said cause there were missing ipad in the room first of all when i checked in no one told me there will be an ipad in the room anyways i got the keys ansmy niece and i visited new york for to celebrate two special birthdays our tickets to hamilton and our stay at the cassa times square made this a memorable trip its hard to find a room in midtown with two beds so our room at the cassa was perfect throom was smaller than in the picture but clean desk is too high to use wierd uncomfortable desk chair with no back just a high bar around the back no place to open a suitcase tv only receives a few random cable stations 2 blocks from javits and lowe were greeted by diana and immediately offered bottles of water which was so thoughtful she accommodated our requests for quiet rooms and gave us directions to tavola restaurant which is less than a block from the hotel and the food is amazing wheni would like to say i stayed here to celebrate my son 16th birthday and lucy and cesar made it extra special their customer service was excellent made us feel welcome i will definitely stay here againwhen i was looking for a hotel cassa times square had the better price by location for a room with two beds double or queen it was relatively easy for me to find a room with a single queen at a better price but not as easy to find two beds i thoughall the receptionists was very kind and nicethe room is goodthe bed is is goodthe breakfast is goodthe location is okthe size of the room is okthere is no place to let the luggages in case of early checkin and after checkoutthe front desk employee jessica was on fire tonight i set back and watched her check two guests before me and i was like i cant wait until my turn she was professional consistent with the information given and super personable shes a service sthe location was great several points of interest were within a 1015 minute walk the hotel always provided cold water for on the go the staff were always friendly and respectful the rooftop of the hotel was a cool spot to relax after each day of expthe hotels website says that this is a luxury 4 star hotel when in reality it is a 2 star hostel the room was spacious enough but had a wooden floor with no carpet it had a mottled brown ceiling which reminded me of a nicotine stained ceiling in an oeverything about this hotel experience made my trip so much better i have to shout out michael who was immensely helpful kind and funny he has the graveyard shift so that should speak volumes about his level of service my cousin has a baby on the waroom was clean and staff were very friendly they were able to send us to a great italian restaurant rooftop patio was great for vewing downtown ny city both at

Crowne Plaza Times Square Manhattan,i was there for a business trip location is awesome right in the thick of the manhattan rooms are comfortable and decently sized breakfast served at the brasserie is a bit expensive but the spread is decent overall service is excellent at the hotelmy husband bought me tickets for a broadway show for my birthday so the crowne was the perfect spot for all of the planned events it was easy to get to penn station the empire state building and central park the hotel was clean and everything was welhotel is in time square on broadway perfect location for sightseeing and seeing broadway shows hop on hop off bus picks up right in front of hotel great customer service clean and comfortable roomsvery disappointed on arrival for such a prominent hotel the room looked like it hadnt been decorated in over 20 years furniture all scrapped and dirty cupboard the carpet was disgusting dirty tissue on bedside table on arrival temperamental showethe service at this hotel is impeccable every single employee i came into contact with exhibited genuine care and consistent great hospitality traveling alone i wasnt interested in checking out the local food unless the hotel food wasnt up to pai spent two nights with family in may at this hotel the location is wonderful you can walk to everywhere and the subway is close by the room was clean and felt updated the beds were comfy i did not use the lounge or other amenities while there so i cthe lobby and other public spaces of this hotel are dated shabby and need an overhaul there is construction on the outside of the hotel so maybe that is in the works there is really no lobby just a lounge so nowhere really to sit while waiting forroom was full size not tiny like some ny hotels it was nicely furnished with comfortable beds and it was very clean the view from the 30th floor was nice and we were within easy walking distance of many restaurants subway stops and the jumbotrons ostay report  531  62location seemingly every hotel between 33rd and 51st 10th avenue to 6th avenue claims to be times square so thats a meaningless term  specifically this hotel is located on broadway between 48th and 49th the hotel takes uthe crowne plaza times square manhattan provided a solid hotel experience nice corner room excellent bed and conference facilities overall the staff were nice but service was a bit mixed a great location thanks for an excellent stayjewellery was stolen from bedside table reported with no response went in to discuss with security and was told an investigation would take place

walking distance into the best shopping and most happening places of downtown nyc it is also near to most of the broadway theatres so one can do the late nfor our first time in nyc this was a great

breakfast buffet great breakfast buffet special thanks and compliments to the breakfast staff especially samathe corner rooms are nice the others are pretty average on par with most 4 star hotels the

really good had to wait an hour even when we made a reservation nice hotel very busy and a bit faceless but nice rooms with very comfy beds great views from our room helpful staff but the best thing about this hotel is its position right at the heart of times squarewe stayed in a corner room on 41st floor and rarely heard any noise from others in hotel outside street noise was minimal i asked for a couple of things regarding housekeeping and was supplied with them very quickly  water from faucet in bath is greavery comfortable room with a great central location in times square the bed almost made you not want to get up and everything was clean and spotlessbreakfast buffet was good and staff were always happy to helpgood location currently my family of 4 is staying here for 5 nights with the city view of time square corner view guest assistance was so fast to accommodate our needs the only thing they forget is i requested a special thing for my daughter for herafter a long drive from florida upon arrival we had an issue with valet parking the manager on duty fixed that problem and we were introduced to evelyn to complete our checkin evelyn was very kind which helped ease my frustration with valet and mamy husband and i travel 6 times a year 3 internationally our experience with ihg has varied from excellent to disappointing we rented two adjoining rooms with granddaughters on june 19 20 and 21 at the crown plaza times with points and cash i had cai stayed at the cpts with my two daughters from july 26th 2019 from start to finish this hotel gets 5 stars

cruise and this hotel before we even travelled i had a bad expereince as my wife is diabetic and needs a small fridge in a hotel room to store insulin i emailed the hotel to ask if rooms alri booked the cpts for my birthday again and was lucky to have donald check me in hes always the caring professional and allocates my room preference  this time a wonderful corner room on a higher floor it is greatly appreciated after arriving in ttop location and all staff are very professional and nice all the time i am quite impressed by their service i want to give them 5 star but i cannot due to that they charged double that comes 18k for 9 nights with two rooms i found this strange chargi stayed here for one night after arriving from london access from the airport jfk is fairly straightforward on public transport and with the traffic in nyc i chose the subway as a fairly painless way to get to the heart of nycthe hotel is currentlytofael was great and made breakfast a pleasure he was always willing to do anything he could to make our experience even better the breakfast was great and we will come again thank you tofael you made it a better experiencewe stayed for 4 nights in crowne plaza and were a family of 8 our check in experience was not too good even though the reception was quite and all receptionist were by themselves they were not welcoming at all and didnt really provide any informatioi asked for a mini bar and they brought me with a medicine that another guest had left i called the room service and complained to her and she said she was sending me a farm to clean my room a guy came to me only with a bathing cap and told me he wouldour family stayed here when visiting nyc a very pleasant stay and so close to everything we walked everywhere because it was close to all we wanted to do staff was nice and friendly rooms were clean and comfortable price was high due to graduation wmy kids and i stayed at crowne plaza time square for a couple of days the hotel was good until someone decided to help themselves to a package that was delivered there for me i made several enquiries but i kept being transferred from one person to anotif you want to stay close to times square this is a pretty good choice we reserved a king bed city view in midjune 2019 and was given a corner room at the top floor 46th floor  northeast corner this corner room gives you nearly a wraparound view ofthis is a great hotel because of location and room quality is great for the price there are a few things that very much annoyed me enough to write about it so here is my story i reserved my room on the 27th of this month and due to issues with my fligwe booked two double beds for our stay however upon arrival they did not have a room available and so they upgraded us to a room with a king size bed and a sofa bed for the kids with views of times square as well as free breakfast which was greatly apprestayed in this hotel for five days and four nights during a recent trip to new york the best thing about this hotel is the location  its right at the heart of times square where all the action isthe room was clean modern and actually spacious by nenew york is one of the cities i love to visit i decided to stay in the crowne plaza this time to see how things are here lets start off by saying excellent excellent customer service by the receptionist sandra i travel a lot for work and stayed inrahi not only offered great bartending services but he also gave us useful information helped us get the most out of our vacation and booked us a reservation close to the venue of our evening activitiesrahi served us in the lounge every night we stayed at the hotel he was very friendly and suggested what to do on our trip rahi was very helpful and even made us a dinner reservation for one night of our tripthe crowne plaza was an ideal location we walked to so many things the rooms are spacious comfortable and clean some of the staff were less than friendly but our overall visit was fantastic the breakfast buffet was average the loungebar area was nthe check in was quick this was important after a very busy day the room was clean and comfortable the location of the hotel is near everything dining shopping and the downtown area there is a mall right next to the hotel the parking lot can be acwhen was checking out of the hotel sandra esp of the hotel she was excellent agent very kind and helpful i enjoyed in the hotel thank you all and have a great day  ahmed from saudi arabia nice to meet you had a room for four of us on the 33rd floor overlooking the hudson river no noise we all slept very well following our busy days in nycgood sized room with 2 comfortable double beds lovely clean fresh beddingroom furniture was dated but didnt botive stayed at a number of crowne plazas over the years and i remember them almost always being a good experience and while the location truly cant be beat for wanting to be in times square this one feels stuck in a time warp while the lobby feelwe arrived from delhi after a 20hrsflight immigration and new york traffic at the hotel which is located bang in the heart of the famous time square they have a nice private porch for pick up  drop off in this busy district rude shock starts now,i was there for a business trip location is awesome right in the thick of the manhattan rooms are comfortable and decently sized breakfast served at the brasserie is a bit expensive but the spread is decent. Service at this hotel is impeccable every single employee i came into contact with exhibited genuine care and consistent great hospitality traveling alone.

Four Points by Sheraton Manhattan Midtown West,as long time starwoods members weve stayed at all of the four points hotels in manhattan the new four points manhattan midtown west is the best of them all under the outstanding leadership of eddie donovan who with his entire staff was extraordinai booked a room at this hotel as an spg gold member i arrived for my stay to check in only to find out that my room is not ready i returned 4 hours later and was finally able to get my keys when i opened the door to my room i was essentially confronive stayed across the spectrum of hotels in nyc and i always come back to this one which has become my second home away from home cant beat the great balance of service facilities and location especially if youre attending a conference at the jacthis one night with the airconditioning sound in room 710 it is so loud intermittently all day and night hope can change the room tomorrow or ask for earplug in general it is a comfort room except this terrible soundthis is a new hotel wood panel fancy light switches and colorful carpets the hallways are a bit stuffy needs ventilation but both the bed and restroom is top notch the best part was the staff katrina in specific was very friendly and helpfulall in all we were happy with this hotel just dont expect luxury the rooms are clean and modern checkin and checkout went smoothly friendly staff all around there is a lot of construction going on so it can be a bit loud and the breakfast choidont know where to start you know when you check out and are asked how was your stay and you want to say disaster but dont to begin with were told on the phone that weekend parking on street outside is ok signage says otherwise for saturday bi stayed at the four points by sheraton manhattan midtown west hotel for 4 days it must be the nicest hotel in all of new york city i have stayed in other hotels in nyc but none are as nice as this one i had an incredible room with an amazing view offirst lets get the good parts done great location modern hotel with good amenities great views and great transport links i stayed here with my wife and two friends we had a queen room on the 18th floor room was an ok size but with minimal wardrobi mistakenly made reservations for a king bed and needed two beds tryell at the front desk was very helpful and accommodating tryell helped us get into a room to for my family even thought he hotel was sold out i really appreciate his enthusiastic pi cant overemphasize just how genuinely friendly the staff are from reception to the cleaning staff the restaurant everyone seemed out to make you feel welcome impressive cleanliness our room on arrival was very tidy sheets clean so was the batwe picked this hotel because its relatively new and hoped that there wouldnt be any bed bugs or any kind of insects but i got a nasty insect bite not sure if its bed bugs when i woke up in the morning i hope the hotel should do a better job cleanigreat hotel conveniently located a 5 minute walk to the javitz center where a lot of bolt and megabus drop offpick up and a 10 minute walk to penn stationmany subway connections there were a few good reasonably priced restaurants nearby like frwas attending a meeting at the javits convention center the hotel is 2 blocks away comfortlable beds no need for shuttle nicely appointed rooms not big but modern and clean front desk and bell staff very helpful restaurant on first floorstayed for 4 nights in dec 2017 this hotel is in a very convenient location away from the bustle of times square there are subway stations within a 5 minute walk which we found very convenient the area overall felt safe the hotel is very clean and qui travel to manhattan often for work and have at last found my goto business hotel close to penn station so easy and convenient but just far enough west that the neighborhood isnt considered as desirable or glamorous as chelsea or times sq and yet tthis is a very good hotel in the sense of size cleanliness and service the hotel is practically new so the furniture and the hotel itself is in very goos conditiondi would improve the gym and a wider variety in the restaurant menuif you are going fori generally like this hotel its decorated nicely and in particular the front desk staff is extremely courteous somehow after just 1 visit when i returned 2 months later or so they had remembered my name or they did their homework regarding guestsmy mother and i spent one night at this hotel during the recent winter storm i was quite stressed out upon arrival as our flight had been canceled and we had to pack up and transfer from another hotel in a hurry eddie the bellman met us outside in thwe stayed 5 night the rooms are clean and new stuff are nice location is perfect free water coffee tea in the lobby nice restaurant great value for your money very recommended to stay in this hotelwe onky stayed a night but it was really nice the staff is courteous and focused on ensuring a pleasant stay our room was small but extremely comfortable we didnt visit but there is a bar and restaurant just off the lobby the property is two blocks fmanhattan midtown west took the utmost care of me and my friends for our stay in nyc the staff was kind and helpful at all times and the rooms and hotel as a whole was very clean would definitely come againgreat location for lots of things in new york staff greatroom was good though beds a bit narrow bathroom was fab though water pressure not greatwe noticed plenty of parking places nearby and there was a great deli not far up the roadfront entrance is not on 10th bad signage taxi has to round the block to get to the 35th street door easy walk from the javitz once you find the place no doorman taxi service is nonexistant at this location front desk just tells you to get an uberstayed in one of the higher level room and it was very quiet rooms are larger than typical nyc hotels decent size room good size bathroomshower ac was quiet quality furniture super comfy pillows lol we had a very quick checkin even though addrespent 3 nights at the four points its a smaller hotel but relatively new and still quite clean and maintained its locations is excellent if you are attending a conference or tradeshow at the javits center its two blocks away and a straight shwe were driving into nyc when our car had problems coming through the lincoln tunnel we were only able to get one block from the tunnel when the car broke down steps from the four points hotel at 444 10th ave ny it was raining so while we were waitingafter staying many times at four points on 40th and elements on 39th i must say that this four points on 35th10 surpases both of them by a very large margin in terms of quality it feels a lot more modern the room service is very fast and all 4 mealsjust returned from a 5 night stay great location very clean and modern big bed large shower and staff are great always helpful and courteous would definitely stay again and the city view was worth havingstayed for three nights while attending the 2019 pga championship because of its proximity to penn station decent rooms at a reasonable nightly rate beware of the noise in the area due to a lot of construction the exterior windows and hvac are also noi cant say enough nice things about this hotel especially the staff they really go out of their way to make sure you have a great stay here i was here for a week and will definitely stay again the room has lots of outlets including usb and light shotel staff were great and the hotel itself was really nice so the location is so unfortunate when i checked in there was a note saying construction wouldnt go past 6pm  which i thought would be fine cue relentless noisy jackhammering every nightthis is a new hotel in the gentrified hudson yards area very nice albeit small rooms they have a bar and breakfast area since its new everything is in great shape a bit pricey at this level but hey its manhattanthe pros  good location if you are going to javits center comfy bed with slippers and robes close enough to walk with luggage from penn station store luggagethe cons no room service they stopped the service but still advertise that they have it eeveryone working here is very nice and helpful this does not overcome the terrible location smack in the middle of many construction sites that are working 247 jackhammering all night and clouds of dust make it unpleasanti stayed here for 5 night for trade show at javits and wanted to be as close as i could this is one long block away and hotel was such a nice surprise i arrived exhausted after a long trip and found major construction noise just as i climbed into bed fthe hotel is currently stuck in a construction zone but this is hardly the fault of this hotel who go to good lengths to warn guests on check in and locate you awaythe rooms are typical manhattan small side but well equipped and comfortable good funethical lazy staff stayed here for 2 nights and they didnt even bother changing the bed sheets or cleaning the room on day 2 i left the room at 11am and returned at 5pm with no service i called the front desk who spoke to a manager who told me twe were exhibitors at the summer fancy food show at the javits center in nyc it is the perfect location two blocks to and from the javits to the hotel beautiful rooms and a nice lounge area as well as a nice restaurantfront desk personal were very heexceptionally clean place 20 minutes from times square with helpful attentive staff and good internet free tea and coffee 247 available in the lobby room service and restaurant menu available in the cosy bar along with local craft beerive been for over a week at the hotel clean tidy cozy great bedsmodern well mantainedroom size is perfect bathroom size is perfectrestorant downstairs is great too staff is greati have only one downside to address and it the air conditioner nlocation was very good  rooms good  staff friendly bar in lobby very nice food and beer  drilling starts at 630am monday to friday you can hear it but we was up and was like an alarm clock so wasnt a big deal for us  check in and check all goodeven by having a confirmed reservation from a travel agency they force you on a weekend during your travel to enter your credit card information again  written confirmation was provided in advance and credit card sentmy daughter and i stayed at the four points by sheraton midtown september 2125 this hotel was absolutely perfect our room was not huge but by ny standards it was well above average we had the king bed room and it was more than enough space for two pi dont know where to begin this was an altogether awesome stay from the desk clerks to the restaurant and bar and even the doormanall were professional accommodating and just plain friendly our experience was above expectations and we will defi really tried to give this hotel five stars after all it was impeccably clean with modern rooms and nifty light switches a nice comfortable bed snazzy bathroom layout with sliding door glass shower enclosure and pristine faucet fixtures i realquick checkin we

front desk staff was helpfulwe booked our room months ago for thanksgiving week when we arrived there were signs everywhere explaining that there was construction in the area and they apologized for the inconvenience the pile driver started hammering about 0630 every morning andthe location is perfect for some days of manhattan sightseeing excursions it is well connected and right in the center of midtown west  good base for exploring manhattan from the north to the south the highline begins more or less in front of the hoteno one wants to find a bug inter bed any type of bug but thats what i had after one night at the four points midtown west i called to reception and said there was bug in my bed and i wasnt sure if it was a bed bug or not it took maintenance 35 minut,i stayed at the

absolutely memorable from the moment i arrived i was treated so nicely and respectfully the hotel room assigned to be was just lovely artistic and most elegant there is a certainlets face itnyc is a

were greeted with a smile by lauren and charles who both went above and beyond and helped accommodate our ethere is absolutely nothing bad i can say about this place everything from the prompt valet out front on ninth avenue to the endless room amenities this is the place to stay i dealt with sonia and i must say she is one of the most accommodating youngbooked this hotel for a special birthday treat booked 2 rooms so not a cheap trip nice rooms lovely roof top pool but staff just so indifferent to guests had a few issues which were eventually dealt with but just got the overall impression

that will keep you coming back over and overthis is it everything was sooooo perfect from check in to check out we loved the ambiance the hugefornyc room the attention to detail and lighting and just the entiwe stayed 2 nights at the gansevoort the location is excellent the staff in the hotel is very friendly we had afternoon drinks at the rooftop bar it is a comfortable space with excellent views but the staff seemed to be bothered by us our room wasive recently left new york after living here for 6 years and will always have fond memories of the meatpacking district the gansevoort is among 3 of my favorite hotels in the area as well as the city the staff  particularly yulia at the front deskthe gansevoort is a relativelly small by manhattan standards hotel steps from the high line and the whitney museum its a wonderful location for strolling through the west village touring the high line etc rooms are very large by nyc standards themalik welcomes us with a kind warm and genuine greeting our stay for one night was incredibly fun with drinks on the rooftop followed by a morning swim overlooking the city the gansevoort is trendy cool  in the best neighbourhood huge thanks to malnyc always ahead in designmeatpacking barhotelnot stayed here but will be on my priority list next timeclose to many good restaurant in the same areaamazing how this area grew in the last yearsmy partner and i stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and it is by far one of the most cleanest and friendliest hotels we have stayed at all staff couldnt help you anymore especially melvin at the front desk the hotel and room are so clean the area isstayed two nights ac did not work in lobby or room several times called and stopped at front desk they said they would send maintenance every time it never happened it was a cool 81 degrees in the room and staff would not move us or get the ac issuei used to live in the neighborhood and wanted to stay here on a return trip i knew the rooms and the hotel itself were nice and great location so booked my 6 nights here i shouldve known something was up when on arrival i walked into the lobby thawow met my long distance girlfriend for a romantic getaway in nyc the pictures location and amenities drew us to gansevoort meatpacking nyc but the worldclass service especially lauren at the front desk the detail and cleanliness of the room kingi love the gansevoort for the central location in the meatpacking with a quick walk into chelsea or the west village lauren at the front desk was extremely friendly and helpful and upgraded us from a standard king room into a nice suite for our staywe stayed at this hotel to celebrate our 15th anniversary and went with our friends who were celebrating their 10th we spent extra for a suite in order to celebrate not only was the suite not worth the money it was in shambles when compared to our frithis is the perfect hotel if youre a returning visitor to new york or arent looking to do the typical tourist activities the meatpacking district is a region teeming with quaint coffee houses and upscale eateries not to mention the world renownedi have found this review quite difficult to score as there are many good points so have went in the middle as i think ultimately there are a few real negativesfirstly fabulous location but wouldnt recommend for a week as after a few days you find yohad a great stay here for two nights last weekend very competent hotel with lovely room and facilities in a great location lots of interest nearby eg the high line walked all the way from hotel down to world trade site along hudson bubbys dinerstayed here 3 nights for work and will keep coming back have been to all the nearby hotels dream maritime standard but this was my first time at gansevoort and it did not disappoint the location is adorable and it sits on a cute street with a fun ijust back from this amazing hotel great customer service staff cant do enough for you to make your stay pleasurable really helpful and will advise on anything regarding the area only downside is that its expensive especially on the roof top barthe gansevoort meatingpacking is a very nice hotel with lovely rooms and amenities the spacious room with comfortable bed a nice seating area with a view of the new restoration gallery illy coffee  fiji water couldnt be nicer the location was alsostayed here for two wonderful nights location is unbeatable  steps from the highline chelsea market and the west village outside theyve completely renovated the street and sidewalks  it feels like a european square the hotel was lovely awesomemy family had a wonderful experience at the gansevoort this past weekend kenya in reservations and lauren at the front desk offered my family three rooms on the same floor all with a view of the hudson in spite of the on againoff again rain the viewwe had an amazing stay here at gansevoort we had a hectic day but lauren helped best assist us and made our stay worth while she handled everything quickly and professionally 5 stars for lauren if you come to this hotel go through laurenthe hotel was amazing and beautiful and everyone was very kind but i have to say that lauren at the front desk was exceptional she went out of her way to make us feel welcome and make sure we were aware of all the amenities and best spots around the hotfor this first visit in ny with the family previously only in ny on business trips i reserved the gansevoort it turned out not only to be the best location ever to do the many things we wanted for a 48hrs walk and see with many shops restaurants andi love the west village and the gansevoort is definitely a go to julia the manager on duty at my checkin was super nice and made my stay very comfortable i had a room on one of the higher levels so had a great view of the city great room great toii had been to the gansevoort for cocktails in the uber trendy roof bar a few years ago and always wanted to stay there so booked in with the family from the 21st december to the 24th december last and what a great choice that was we were looked afterwhile i dont claim to be an nyc expert not have i lived in this city ive visited too many times to count and stayed in various areas i really feel that as a tourist this is the best neighborhood its hip trendy vibrant safe and fun it aexcellent surprise the hotel is modern comfortable clean the service is outstanding at all levels lauren at the reception gave me a most useful lecture about the meatpacking district and pointed me to the right restaurants very professional very hfirst time i stayed there rather than just coming to visit the bar lauren in particular was great an made me feel welcome great identity to the hotel and their staff apparently i need to write more to make 200 charactersthanks teamgreat hotel  service and staff number 1 the best in this part of town  great bar and music at night  nightclub awesome  our suite was beautiful  not big but we loved it  convenient to walk to everywhere  we r going back this month me and my childhood friends flew from trinidad to nyc for the weekend we forgot our luggage in trinidad and i arrived even without shoes just in sandals it was raining and super windi we explained our situation at the front desk and after a couples ththis place is an icon in meatpacking i used to live around the block and would come to the rooftop on summer nights stayed for business this week and its just as awesome staying there perfect location great restaurant in the hotel awesome gym andit is hard to beat this location the hotel is close to restaurants shopping and a short walk from the high line and hudson yards the hotel itself was ok not super fancy but everything you need our room was clean the bed was comfortable and our acmade the mistake of staying here for a one night business trip this hotel is about a 35 i am currently in my room and hear construction and other noise outside came back to my room after a long day of traveling since 4am and working and it took 5 p,a pleasure to stay at this hotel the rooms are impeccable the vibe is unique and the location is hard to beat lauren at reception makes all the difference with her positive attitude and friendly service highly recommended julia at checkout was great. The gansevoort is in one of the best neighborhoods in town is accessible torooms are clean comfortable and relatively large for nyc our room had a river view and a seating area which we enjoyed.

garden inn it is in a great location close to all of the activities around times square the other thing which was great is that they have parking in the building so you dont have to go find parking aroundway too strong of a perfume smell when walking into the lobby it was there at night and there in the morning way way too strong i was greeted by elizabeth and devon who were excellent and accommodated my request of a lower floor which apparently isnwe have been bringing our daughter to nyc to see shows and plays since she was 6 years old she is 15 now we often stay at the hilton garden inn on 8th ave because it is a perfect walk to both central park and the theatre district one of the highlighti am staying at this memorial day weekend and i hope this hotel is nicer than some of the staff i had a problem with my credit card so i called the hotel to update my credit card hold and could not get through for 2 hours and when i finally got throughmy friends and i really enjoyed our stay good location nice rooms breakfast included a decent convenient shop inside and the most welcoming staff charles the concierge is now our new york dad ask for a riddle he has some good ones i

this hotel the location the cleanliness the extrewe spent 6 days in nyc with a party of 7 you can only imagine how complicated transportation was we even had to buy another large suit case to bring back all of our souvenirs since our group consisted of two adults 4 children and grandma we really nroom spacious and beds super comfortable also good central location i travelled with a friend and stayed 3 nights then we went to washington overnight and returned a further 5 nights unfortunately though prepaid there was no room with 2 beds availablefirst time at this hotel the location is great

andhotel was clean staff was very friendly and helpful one minor issue in room and it was fixed so quickly special call out to charles the concierge he spoke to us every day assisted us in finding places we were headed make my 90 year old mother feelexcellent customer service charles jules roman and the entire staff made us feel so welcome and were very helpful this particular hilton will be my hotel of choice for all future nyc trips beds were comfortable and hotel was quietlocation great right in the heart of theater district staff very accommodating however while we have stayed there several times before the hotel is in need of some cosmetic updatesfree breakfast is minimalwe travelled from ohio to nyc to see a yankees game and also wanted to check out the times square area this was a great choice rooms were awesome and the staff was super nice and helpful charles was one of the employees that we interacted withgreatfront office staff is quite rude called there with the simplest of questions and got transferred to hilton customer service rather than attempt to resolve it my issue was room change that the customer service team cant address it has to be done atwe really enjoyed our stay at this hilton it was conveniently located to many of the new york attractions we visited the staff was friendly and very helpful charles in particular helped us checkin and when we asked for a restaurant recommendation he ewe loved our stay charles and mabel gave us extraordinary service and an overall great time they made our experience even more enjoyable we loved our room the complimentary breakfast and the little store in the lobby with pints of ice cream 1010 hlarge clean room great location for attending a broadway show we would stay here again the only thing that i would suggest would be improvement of the breakfast options it is not worth it go elsewhereour room was 1003 on the backside of the building it was quiet the majority of the time we were just 2 blocks from time square the hotel was very clean the staff were very helpful our flight home was very early in the morning and they arrange for athe only thing this hotel has going for it is the location the housekeeping was horrible and the hhonors breakfast did not exist if you are looking for that hotel that gives you a clean room and a decent breakfast go find another location to stay atour goal was to come and see some broadway shows this hotel is located in a very central part of the theater district and 2 blocks from restaurant row we walked everywhere to 3 different theaters and 2 different restuarants just make sure you goeverything was fine good location and we were able to check in way before the check in time thank you to charles an ken at the door for your help and nice sense of humor parking was next door an location was excellenti really enjoyed staying here especially to be greeted by charles and jules they are so friendly and welcoming they helped us with getting around the city and anything else we might have needed in our stay would 1010 recommendhotel is in a great location rooms were quiet and check in was fast and easy charles was a great help in getting the directions i needed during my stay plus having a parking garage right next door was convenient i plan on staying there again on my nei would definitely recommend the hilton garden inn in times square from the great location in the heart of everything to clean wellsized rooms and friendly staff our last minute trip to nyc could not have been easier in particular charles was verylocation room and bed were great but what made the visit perfect was the staff all were friendly and helpful jules and charles went above and beyond to make our visit extra special we will

experience this time was different we reserved an upgraded corner king room which was very nice however on the first night the tohave stayed here a couple of times very convenient to theater district and all of its bars and restaurants the subway is also convenient if you want to travel a bit further around the city the wifi was easy to connect to and fast we also found thethis is a great location close enough to times square but generally dont hear the noise of it location on 8th avenue nice sized room we got one with a king bed and a sofa bed enough room for 2 or more people plus there is a refrigerator nice stafbrought my teenage daughter to nyc for a motherdaughter weekend first time to nyc and we had an amazing experience hotel was basic clean safe and convenient to everything the

InterContinental New York Times Square,stayed here 1 night on business its an excellent centrally locates hotel in mid town west a block from times square and right next to the ace metro lines as well as 10 other lines within a block there is a direct newark airport bus that leaves fromthis place is a decent place to stay when traveling to nyc great location make it convent when hanging around broadway just be prepared to encounter lots of foot traffic around the hotelclean room and friendly staff make it a pleasant stay not the chi love this hotel they are always so accommodating and the hotel is always such a relaxing place to be the entrance to the e train is right outside the door and you are just a few blocks away from times square and most theaters as well as some of theoriginally we checked into a hotel several blocks away that was sold to us as a 4 star on a well know hotel deal website it was smelly dirty and rundown past the lobby while fighting for a refund i called the intercontinental knowing they would be qui am a hotelier by experience and was very impressed with the attention level of the staff to any issue from check in to check out the property is located close enough to times square to allow you to enjoy all that geography has to offer but just far eni found the hotel convenient and very nice the air conditioning in my room did not work well and the inside handle to the bathroom door was missing but the room was very nice bed was super comfortable and the staff and house keeping were wonderfulamazing hotel staff all very helpful and friendly some wifi problems and in room film didnt work but everything else is 5 star food excellent but a little pricey room service fantastic highly recommendedwe were staying for four nights as a family when we arrived at the hotel around 2300 it was obviously a busy night for them our room had a humming noise and we got upgraded immediately because they didnt have any other rooms left we were met with gthis hotel was perfect the beds were amazingly comfortable  i prefer and have a memory foam mattress at home and this was just as comfortable as home the only complaint i have is that the air conditioner had an issue and the internet was spotty overwere staying at this hotel through next week and i just had the worst service at the hotel bar i sat without a drink for 25 minutes then when it arrived the beer was frozen i then waited 1015 minutes for a replacement the bar is very disorganizthe room was great with good facilities but clothes storage was an issue as we ended up leaving most of our clothes in the suitcasesexcellent for broadway and general access to the city the metro is the way to navigate the citycustomers has to check out at 11am can only check in after 3pm so i assume they have 4 hours to clean the room it doesnt seems four hours are enough for them because i saw someones socks in the corner so obvious that everyone can see itso i reallwe had a layover and spent the night at ic time square we had a king sky corner room the hotel itself wasnt bad but it was definitely not up to typical intercontinental standard location its a block from time square which obviously is super tourii have stayed at this hotel many times before and loved it i even wrote a review a few years ago i was traveling with 2 teenagers and we checked into the room around 800pm i was tired so went to sleep and woke up in the morning to find they only gaveused our anniversary free night and also points to stay here in nyc over the 4th of july weekend and had a wonderful time this hotel was in a super convenient location for heading up the street to a broadway production one night which was a first for mthe ac was broken and rattled it was fixed then broke an hour later the internet did not work either i can suffice to say in all my years on trip advisior and all my stays it was one of the most horrible experiences i have ever had with a hotel i aski was made to feel most welcome from curbside on my arrival all the way through to check in and was treated like royalty my entire stay and untill checkout and again curbside upon leavingrained heavily and the umbrella loan was a special touchlovethis was our 2nd time at this hotel first off it is the perfect location to be able to walk to broadway shows we also walked to the empire state building rockefeller center and times square is very close there are so many restaurants and it is justvery bad services room dirty and not filling with all equipments the staff very rude and not helpful charging extra amounts very old and cleft bath stuff take very long time to serving you the worst intercontinental hotel i lived ini tend to judge hotels by their workout facilities there are weight machinesfree weights several treadmills three ellipticals three stationary bikes 1 recumbent a spin bike and towels water sanitizing cloths this is a clean comfortable hotelalthough the rooms are very comfortable one cannot help but get the impression that the hotel is nothing more than a building with comfortable rooms in the middle of times square and an absolute lack of hospitality and im calling out the reception smy husband and i stayed in the intercontinental time square hotel recently we booked the hotel based on its location and the number of reviews it had i must say we were thrilled the location is a perfect distance from the different tourist attractionswe were lucky to get a last minute flight and a last minute deal at the intercontinental we travel to nyc a few times a year for business but this was a sudden 30th anniversary celebration the front desk is beautiful and our greeter gave us room 2205 wfront lobby stinger restaurant pretty average service people especially banquet staff were excellent food was very good concierge staff helpful but lacking that cando attitude prevalent in the midwest west coast orientthis is a fine hotel located very close to times square yet on a reasonably quiet though busy street my room was large and comfortable with plenty of outlets and a strong wifi signal if you need to be in midtown west this is a very good choicewell placed hotel probably a bit more expensive due to location but big rooms with good sized picture window nice large comfey beds good shower helpful staff if your looking for a bit of luxury this is the placelocation in times square is convenient view was amazing and room was reasonably comfortablehowever a couple of things marred our visit first my wife had to work for a couple of days and was doing so from the room one day an it tech walked right inthe hotel is so clean and nice the view from our room 35th fl was so beautiful especially in the night time i love their delicious breakfast so many delicious choice for you to enjoy the first thing in the morning great services and nice stay ithe service was excellent the staff helped out with a special checkin request fantasticthe hotel is in a great location for those that want to enjoy midtown and the theater districtfood was good room very clean and all amenities were top notchbe swe stayed at the intercontinental in the theater district for two nights and never needed a car the hotel is clean quiet and very comfortable our bathroom had a huge shower that was handicapped accessible we dealt with very friendly helpful staff troom was very nice view of the city out my window was spectacular front desk personnel very courteous breakfast was very good this is the only meal i ate at the hotel my only complaint if you can call it that is that there is very little seatingbooked this hotel for 7 days with a upgraded room which was niceour room was on the 4th floor facing the front of the hotel the noise level was terrible from midnight onwards you had garbage trucks people shouting and fighting then you had the blastingit was a quick walk from penn station to the hotel staff was warm and gracious and willing to help in any way rooms are spacious and clean and bedding was lovely and im a sheet snob would stay there againwe were very pleased at the room sizescleanliness and the staff not being from nyc and having no idea where to stay we researched where to stay and were concerned about areas to stay and room sizes and cleanliness the intercontinental was great on athe location is very convenient albeit noisy however the front desk staff is unfriendly and not helpful i ordered inroom breakfast and the toast is burnt for a 5star hotel this is more than unacceptableloved the intercontinental and got a great rate it is well located spacious modern room helpful staff the beds are very very comfortable the only negative i experienced was that my room rate included an amenities fee of 30 per day which afforded aroom was clean and recently renovated daily destination fee was 30 and requiredreally was just a way for the hotel to cost an additional 30 more per day than the rate we booked we tried to use at least 20 worth of the food in the room but just a plwe dont get to the city often but when we do its go go go all the more reason to have a comfortable place to unwind and sleep i can honestly say my bed was the most comfortable hotel bed i have ever slept inthe hotel was very nice and the rooms had everything we needed throughout our stay the location was great since it was just a couple blocks from times square the rooms were very clean and well kepta great hotel for exploring new york it was close to the subway if you dont like walking but really easy to get up or down town from here the rooms were a good size and clean there was a minor issue at checkin about payment method but was resolvedihg is my first choice for overseas hotel but the standards arent the same prior to this my last stay was at ihg osaka it was simply great here at new york you dont get the same kind of politeness and friendliness you would expect as a touriwe have s pent a week in april in this hotel ithas a pretty good location next to times square and broadway the rooms are cleanquiet and well equipped breakfast is good but expensive

"Martinique New York on Broadway, Curio Collection by Hilton",i was traveling with my two young children and i cant say enough good things about the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff the location is perfect steps from the subway and plenty of good eats all aroundpros location is great short walk to times square madison square garden broadway easily accessible to subway rooms were

above all everyone at the martinique is focused on your comforti have been travelling to nyc for business the past 5 years ive stayed at almost every hotel in nyci have been in nyc for a few months so far for work i found the matinique to be convenient enough to both work and some interesting restaurants its generally quiet with plenty of rooms a usually empty enough fitness center and a pretty decent breaki usually stay close by at one of the hilton garden inns which are pleasant functional and fine but they do lack any real unique character thats not a criticism just a reality i got to stay at this property memorial day weekend the price was fairwe stayed at martinique late may the hotel couldnt have been in a better location situation around a 10 minute walk from the flat iron area and with a few streets of times square  plus a subway right on your doorstep not noisy at all you wouldnthe location was good and it was relatively quiet given the location it was a birthday celebration did even though i told the hotel they made no effort to acknowledge it i had made it clear it when i made the reservation the lobby is under constructiomy family enjoyed this hotel in manhattanour room was moderately sized very well furnished and very clean the bathroom had a large shower no tub to step in the ac unit was noisy as it clicked loudly on and off but there was no noise from other roomcan not believe the cost of this hotel and then the condition its in i understand it is going through a lot of updating but this should reflect in the price you paywe are here at the moment and would not use againeverywhere is so noisythis morning athotel was okay but hindered somewhat by internal and external refurbishment although this couldnt be helped and i wouldnt mark them down for this major disappointment was upfront charge to credit card not a preauthorisation an actual charge ofthe worst possible experience  literally checked in and asked for a refund within 15 minutes upgraded room for hh diamond status the worst i have ever seen for a hilton flys in the lobby dirty corridors hotel basically under construction certjust a little over a block from penn station at the corner of broadway at 32nd st it was very convenient the room as quiet the hotel is the home of the pga when it started in 1916 and they have some nice mementos displayed on the 2nd floor the costi would highly recommend this hotel for the location and the comfort and cleanliness of the rooms we drove in from out of town and there was also parking available for an extra fee  a huge bonus everything is expensive in nyc but this hotel is reasonathis hotel is absolutely beautiful we were greeted by heather b who checked us in and was extremely friendly our room was on the 17th floor and it was huge i have never seen a hotel room this big in nyc ive stayed at many hotels in the city and thclean hotel and pretty close to everything we wanted to do hotel staff was very nice and helped with cars and things around the city  the breakfast place was clean and had pretty good food the room was small but it was fine for my daughter and i one of the better hilton properties ive visited in nyc for the price great customer service and clean larger rooms the french restaurant connected to the hotel is excellent as well convenient to times square macys and korea town plenty of goodthis property appears to have gone downhill since the years when it was a radisson or club carlson hotel perhaps it is still in transition but the window shades were inneffective in keeping light

restaurant had some good wines and an awesome cheese board special thanks to michael a bellman for assistance in grabbing a hit was built 1898 and considered one of the historical hotels in america the skill of restoration is that it kept its old external look and style while inside it turned to a modern state the check in was smooth and quick and liked our room 1022 which isroom was perfect newly renovated 5 steps to the subway and 5 mins to msgnever having stayed in this area or at this hotel before we didnt know what to expect but we couldnt of been more happy i will never stay any

car service to get to the hotel which was a little pricy but convenientthe hotel is nice and very well located however i must say that the experience was not optimal the room had some problems with the ac which was smelly and nosy moreover the room is not soundproof so you can hear everything from the corridorsjust returned from a week in nyc on business and the martinique was a fabulous location one block from penn station right off of herald square the room was adequate  on one of the penthouse floors which gave you access to a lovely lounge the bed wthe hotel was very central to lots of things we wanted to do the underground was very close the empire state building was at the rear of the property the staff were very helpful and the restaurant served good foodover an hour on the phone waiting with a reservations agent regarding price match guaranteei am trying to book 3 nights to no avail hilton official website has a rate significantly higher than bookingcom agoda and

the window is locked and its not possible to openthe housekeeping staff took our cgreat hotel great location the rooms were unexpectedly large for nyc modern bathroom really enjoyed the stay would stay here again friendly staff it was close to penn station and an easy 1 mile to walk to most everything or easy to use subway rigthis old and somewhat traditional establishment is now part of hilton and it therefore bears some level of homogenisation that is inevitable with a chain the rooms are comfortable and even though there were refurbishing works around the main entranceenjoyed staying in this historical hotel rooms are nicely updated clean and comfortable very small bathroom unfortunately but that goes with an older hotel the executive lounge is anything but that but handy if you want a quick cup of coffee or sodgreat location great staff great rooms great hoteljuly 4th trip to the city and it was a great one the martinique is our new hotel of choice when staying in the city convenient to broadway subways restaurants penn station etca most enjoyable short stay made even better due to the charming and helpful staff beds are super comfy even if the rooms are short on stylecertainly recommend as a hotel location in mid town is a bit too busy but that is a personal view most peopleenjoyed the location across the street from macys on 34th empire state building one block away quick access to the subway from a tourist perspective this is a solid location they staff was very helpful and courteous i would stay here again basedwe booked a classic double queen room and ended up in room 427 there is no problem in getting a basic room but this room was very small especially the bathroom one person can stand there and this is 4 person roomwe asked several times to be movi have previously frequented the martinique with no issues when it was still part of the radisson group booked a queen room for a week and was highly disappointed with the stay this timepros location cons the hotel is now part of the hilton grougreat customer service from bellman to receptionist merrill made it possible for me to sleep a little longer after traveling 10 hrs and late check in1am kind and happy morning voice dalma very professional and considerate worked really hard to putwhen i checked in after a long haul flight 12am reception staff said check in time would be 4pm when i asked whether its possible to check with cleaning staff if a room would be available earlier the just repeated check in time is 4pm and started rollstrategic location comfortable bed did not really use any of the hotel facilities as we were out the whole day exploring nyc so could not comment room size is not bad but the lobby is rather small and the elevator is definitely slowif i could id give this hotel more than five stars i recently returned from nyc after staying four nights with my 14 year old son two of my friends their teenage boys this was our first time visiting nyc and chose this hotel based on the positivethe location is perfect close to subways and all the action they even delivered complimentary wine to our room because it was our honeymoon friendly staff we were on the 6th floor and heard no traffic room is small but very clean and efficient we wim a hilton diamond member and spent quite a bit of time calling many of the hilton properties in nyc looking for a few particular needs that we had on this trip1 no resort fee  this is my pet peeve just in principal i wont stay at any hotels thadepending on what you are planning to do this hotel has a convenient location still few steps from the subway walking distance from penn station right in koreatown it is really busy around some parts of the hotel are in renovation we stayed in a lamy wife and i

square and broadway and next doorstayed at the martinique hotel hilton curio collection had a lovely 5 night stay easy checking and checkout friendly staff and our room was comfortable clean and made up every day by the house staff who were also very friendly location was perfect fi stay at hotels almost every day because i am a speaker most of what i speak on has to do with treating your clients with respect to better your business i arrived at hotel after an international flight at 9am and wanted to check into my room theythe experience of the martinique was so special because of the staff and the character of the hotel it has working elements from the late 1800s that add so much to the stay the pga tour was started here by a board meeting in the early 1900s how coolexcellent room for the price and location lots of refurb work going on which im sure will make it a great location lots of history in the hotel too 200 yards to macys 500 yards to empire state ideala very nice historic hotel that is clean and a nice change from the traditional hilton garden inn in nyc the rooms were clean food was great and the bathroom was all updated and fresh i would stay here again while in nycthe location is really good and everything is around the subway station is on the corner of the street the size of the room was good and the bed was really comfortable i went to the gym it was small but nicethe room was spotless and smart as were the facilities the hotel has character which i prefer to bright shiny and soullessthe check in team were professional and helpful however except for michael the concierge service was poorthe breakfast offerinthe hotel was being renovated so i cant comment on it properly so ill just keep my review about the staff all of the staff were amazing from the check in receptionist who gave me a bottle of water whilst i was feeling dehydrated to the customwe stayed late june 2019 location is perfect close to subway station and macys staff was very helpful would recommend staying here we used the subway and walked as well only about a 20 minute walk to times squarealthough my arrival at the hotel was not auspicious given the exterior renovations and ongoing works in the reception area i enjoyed my stay essentially for two reasonsfirstthe room was comfortable with a well appointed and new bathroom and was very qthe martinique is right on the doorstep of the empire state building and perfect for visiting all the tourist hotspotswe booked it for fight night at madison square garden which was perfect and took a whole 6 minutes to walk therethe rooms are a good sthis hotel is in a great location staff was friendly and helpful rooms were clean and nice size except for the bathroom was small but in new york its expected beds a little

broadway fifth ave etchotel is good staff is friendly always ready to help i think it is a grat deal metro station is at the cornerthe room was really spacious and clean the location was very convenient next to a metro station and close to the best spots  empire state building etc the check in was a bit slow but the hotel was very beautifulthis is a very good hotel in the heart of manhattan the pricequality ratio is very good as well i had just a little problem with checkin because at 3pm the room was not ready yet i usually do not have breakfast because is nothing specialthe superior experience of this hotel started a few days before with my calls to customer service denise with whom i spoke was personable and extremely responsive to my requests overall the customer service at the martinique is on point excellent bwe spent a few nights here three rooms family trip other than the renovation going on everything in the hotel was solid the people the room location its an old building so you can expect areas that could be better such as the elevators but thi decided to spend a weekend away from home with my husband and selected the martinique new york on broadway as a special treat for both of us we both had a recent birthday and our anniversary was in may and therefore based on the reviews i wanted it tohilton really does a good job in revitalizing this former radisson which looked very rundown the lobby is currently under renovations and i am sure it will look great when it is reopened during the summer unlike other hiltons the bell staffs were greception area under renovation with an unwelcoming rude reception staff there was a line for checkin i waited until the last guest had finished checking in when i walked up to the desk the person at the desk was about 15 away from me instead of gfantastic location in little korea heart of broadway near the empire state building and if you like shopping macys is across the road short walk to time square and not far from central park very nice rooms comfortable beds sound reduction in roomi frequently travel to ny for business and the martinique is always my first choice when choosing a hotel customer service is excellent and the rooms have more space and are cleaner than many of the other hotels i have stayed at in ny great locationkeeping in mind that this hotel is under renovation in the lobby area we still probably wouldnt stay again we are diamond members and this was the absolute worst checkin experience ever there was only 2 employees checking people in with no hhonorsroom was some much larger than the other hotels in the area very clean and convenient to everything i stay at a lot of hotels and this by far was a great experience i would bring my family back to this hotelfantastic hotel and fantastic location all staff friendly and helpful as a mother and daughter on a new york trip we additionally felt safesecure knowing reception was 24 hours and doormen always present would definitely stay here again as cannot fait was really too bad arrived at midnight after a little less than a 10 minutes walk from penn station to find a line for checkinbecause only one person was available thats right one person not only to check in guests but to also deal with thebusiness trip for 3 nights in nyc prolocation if you like to be close to pann stationi had king side

comfortable however everything else was amfaimly trip to new york city for the holiday weekend we wanted a place that was close to midtown but not in and close to soho loved this property perfect location good vibe super nice and helpful staff really liked danny at the front desk the tokensi stayed two nights here on business it was a good experience and i would stay here again super clean

location moxy this was my first moxy experience it is unique the staff was wonderful the rooms are small but efficient you can request a refrigerator but they are not typically in the rooms thtraveling for work i stayed at the moxy chelsea for 2 nights in april 2019 just a few weeks after they first opened i was delighted to see that marriott is getting into the boutique hotel scene checkinthe lobby is discrete and hidden behind a lovenot all properties are catering towards or good for families so definitely want to say that i understand if this property is geared towards more hip young single people but i feel like even for that crowd this hotel has some challenges at 500nighfirst time staying at moxy the service and friendly employees are what makes everything the best rooms are well designed and they have every essential needs of a guest keep yourself open minded about your expectations especially about the design of thwhile the rooms are small they are welldesigned with nice amenities we had no issue with street noise likely in part because ny streets are much quieter than the avenues but what really made the difference for us was the service my daughter contracwe recently visited the moxy chelsea whilst in nyc for a show we had 4 fantastic nights in the hotel and would love to stay again a very stylish modern hotel with friendly staff and clean rooms a busy lively bar area which serves food and has a dj plawe spent a long weekend and found this hotel to have everything we needed its a block from the 28th street station and made it very easy to get around the hotel opened in february and still has its newness the second and top floor have bar spaces thwe had to events in the city and instead of driving back and forth we decided to

location is perfect and the staff could not be more helpful especially danny  who really went above and beyond to ensure we had an incredible tripmoxy is a contemporary little nugget of a hotel that sits at the heart of a bustling district and because its a small establishment it was a bit of a struggle having came from a long work trip and didnt had the luxury of travelling light we had 5 bigthe staff was constantly helpful even during my late pm arrival i was amazed at how welcoming sheana was at such a late hour the room was fantastic and the ambiance was relaxing had a great gym for its size as wellthis is a new hotel from the marriott moxy brand  small and simpler but high quality rooms and great restaurants and public areas it is targeted at a bit more of a youngparty crowd than me 200 night per year upscale to luxury business travethis very attractive boutique hotel is wonderfully placed in the flower district easy subway access and much within walking distance the staff was exceptionally nice the room was very clean and attractive the bed was very comfortable and the price istayed here last weekend with my boyfriend for a city trip i had initial room shock to how small

well as we traveled light we requested a city view king ri had an amazing time at the new moxy hotel in chelsea this past week beautiful hotel and comfortable room smells like flowers as soon as you walk in the lobby location is very convenient for exploring different areas of the city christian assisted mmy sisters and i did an overnighter in manhattan and stayed at the moxy it was perfect upon our arrival there were bottles of water and champagne glasses for the four us to begin our celebration we had the room with the four bunk beds and it was fabuwe booked this hotel for the bed

one nightwere in our 20s and 30s ive stayed at some hotels in thei stayed here last month as family was visiting from out of town and absolutely loved this new property as someone that has worked in the industry the atmosphere and staff of this hotel were amazing shout out to christian for assisting me at the frolovely flower smell from the entrance is going to welcome you casual and friendly service will be provided from the front desk highlight is the room unbelievablly beautiful room very stylish and extremely cozy and comfortable bed with stunning citymodern hotel and nice bar however there are soiled stained towels in the stairwells blocking the fire exit slow lifts waited half an hour to get into our room due to the mobile lock running out of batteryoverall pretty disappointed and interested toi had the opportunity to stay for 3 days keneisha is one of the best personalities ive meet through marriot ill be staying here whenever im in new york appreciate your amazing grace see you guys again soonid prefer to give this a 45 than 5 as i had the ill fortune of getting a cold shower one morning but solicited everyone else in my group and i guess it was just me so will let it slide more on the positive side of the review however id have to say tstayed here on a whim for staycation overall i can see what the hotel is trying to do in terms of concept and how they can appeal to specific generation of people to that end the hotel does it rather well if you have the right expectation for thfrom penn station to moxy chelsea is a 7 minute walk through the flower district the entrance is beautiful and smells wonderfull with all the flowers from putnam  putnam the checkin area is very trendy we got a very very warm and nice welcome frommy stay at the moxy hotel in chelsea was wonderful the hotel is absolutely stunning what made it extra special was the woman who checked me in while i dont know what her name is she remembered my name and called me by name every time she saw me inno closet no space not quiet no desk to work from dont stay here if you are on business or need space to relax and work this hotel is more suited for party goers and has a nice club to serve that purposei loved this hotel great location in the flower district rooms are modern and clean on the smaller side but very comfortable the rooftop bar is amazing and very instragramable would definitely stay there again,hospitality customer service attention to detail energised and upbeat staff personalities gorgeous lobby garden and 2nd floor decor comfy beds and ample size bathroom 35th floor restaurant and bar is a mustsee great locationi stayed in 2107 and had a sensational view of the empire state building from my room  great at night the hotel is nestled in the garden district with easy access to madison avenue broadway and the flatiron district.
NobleDEN Hotel,we stayed at the nobleden hotel for a short family holiday it is positioned in a great location with lots of restaurants on your doorstep the nearest subway is only a 5 minute walk we had the most delicious fresh pastries delivered from the italian baamidst a 48 hour visit to nyc was pleasantly surprised a boutique hotel nobleden on grand st between mulberry and mott provided the perfect oasis to relax recharge and proceed with 2 full days of meetings at lexington ave grand central on 42nd strstayed here for three nights with my husband and daughter all three of us stayed at a king juliette room the bed was big enough for the three of us but the room was a bit tight which was expected wasnt a fan of the open bathroom though the balconythe hotel is great the manager is lovely and so welcoming one of the staff members was a bit grumpy maybe she was having an off day though the room was small we had 2 x adults and 2 x children but thats new york for you would have loved the showe stayed here for 8 nights and it was an excellent base for us close to different subways close to little italy and chinatown no laundry service at the hotel but there was a laundromat just around the corner bathroom was massive and the shower headi really enjoyed my stay at nobleden it can be challenging to find a relatively costeffective and wellsituated hotel in manhattan and this very well may be it i liked my room with a view of grand street and though the street noise was intense i mdown the block from the little italy sign the neighborhood is ideal for walking around day or night clean decently sized rooms with all of the required amenities at a reasonable price especially enjoyed the large showerwe take a family trip or at least with one of the kids to nyc every couple of years we typically stay in hells kitchen very accessible and great restaurants but we decided to try a new locationnobleden is a nice hotel right in little italy and chiwe arrived a 3 hours early and was told by reception that our room was ready but we had to pay an early checkin fee of 25 it baffled us as it was not as extravagant as half a day earlier this is our first encounter of such additional charges we refwe two adults stayed at nobleden for one night in april 2019 upon checkin our room was immediately available and served our short stay perfectly  it was incredibly clean quiet and completely smokefree which is crucial for us  even a hint of resvery clean rooms with a large comfortable bed and spacious shower nobleden provides all the hotel amenities from toiletries hair dryer to hotel slippers and a cute stuffed toy to take home the rooms were spotless and well planned to utilise the spacevery comfy clean and perfectly situated for a nyc tripmodern interior beds are very good view from the rooftop is marvelous lots of bars and restaurants around coffee and tea all over the day for free strictly recommendedrooms in the hotel are clean and fresh beds really comfy staff are friendly and helpful location is great loads nearby and easy to get other places subway not far overall great hotel and really worth the moneythis hotel is simply amazing the rooms are spacious and very clean the surrounding area has everything you could want and need the hotel rooms are also stocked with all of those things we seem to forget ie toothbrush toothpaste and qtipsthe stafwe loved our stay there always something to see in the area special thanks to michelle leader of the cleaning ladies she did an awesome job and was very polite also the reception team is always there for you and makes you feel welcomed we miss thegreat room loved the juliette balcony could see both little italy and china town from it the shower and bathroom mirror were also pretty cool would definitely stay here again 200 characters is too many for a hotel reviewswanky sleek and clean but what stands out most was how accommodating the hotel staff is to the guests early checkin was no issue for the staff as well as safely holding bags in the lobby the location couldnt get any closer to the heart of little itstep outside and find yourself in bubbly little italy metro stations close in all directions small walks to soho tribeca brooklynbridge etc the lack of a hotelrestaurant is not a problem since there are plenty of options just steps away rooms ari normally stay in a very different part of nyc and i usually pay much more than i did here i chose this location out of convenience because i had business in three different parts of the city so i tried to be centralized this hotel straddles the littny is expensive when it comes to good accommodation and areathis hotel was brilliant for the money we spent right in between little italy and chinatown and only 3 blocks from the closest subway stationrooms were modern staff friendly they provide complmodern and clean facilities we loved our stay mostly because of location and neighbourhood they only offered coffee and croissants for breakfast but really not a problem when you live right across the ferrara italian bakery and cafe also cosy bar neroom was spotless clean had the best shower comfy bed cold ac great location in little italy and i loved how the hotel utilizes room space excellent morning coffee  pastries will definitely stay here againi stayed at the hotel recently for 6 nights with my sister we shared a king bed room the room itself wasnt huge but this is normal for new york and we had plenty of space for the 2 of usthe water pressure in the shower is really great alsowe were innobleden has a very friendly and helpful staff the hotel was immaculate and a great place to relax from the chaos of nyc the shower was like being massaged by a waterfall if you stay here dont forget to check out

morning and charming helpful front desk staff and fabulous manager morgan dowe really liked this hotel our room was fairly big especially by nyc standards and we both had space to have our suitcases

perfect choice we stayed in a king room overlooking the street as with most new york city hotels it is a little small however our room was designed perfectly and had everythini just came back from a week long stay at nobleden nobleden is a small 7 storey boutique hotel we had two people to a queen room facing the rear of the building it would be really nice to have the juliet balcony facing grand

and chinatown we are big walkers so we also walked to and over brooklyn bridge ubered back dined in little italy thi rarely stay in hotels in nyc so we really loved the proximity of this hotel to some of the best foodshoppingetc in manhattan and i really loved the boutique feel of this hotel as well from the spacious rooms yes spacious for nyc standards to thewe tried something different on this nyc trip  instead of staying at a chain near times square we stayed here in little italy we got to the hotel early in the afternoon and one of our two rooms was ready we booked a queen for us parents and a doublethis was a great stay the hotel staff was incredibly polite and accommodating the room is the most efficient use of space you can image we really liked the neighborhood and the restaurant next door we will definitely stay againi was very disappointed in this place the rooms are very small there is no place to put your luggage the place was very clean and the staff was great very friendly although the room was very efficient it was too small for me the hvac and water presthe title reflects what happens when you walk out the front door of this hotel so its location is remarkable and fun much nicer than staying in times sq the room is intelligently and stylishly laid out it was quiet on a saturday night the bed was cthis is very comfy and super clean hotel the staff was helpful showing us around and giving us useful tips morgan  the hotel manager  was extremely polite and gave several very useful advices and very polite the rooms were extremely clean thi recently stayed at the nobleden having chosen it for its proximity to a wedding i was attending in hanover square while i could of course have stayed closer to the wedding i wanted to stay at a place that was a bit more in the thick of it nobledencomfortable boutique hotel right in the centre of all the soho little italy chinatown and tribeca actionfriendly hotel manager and stafftea and coffee available in foyer all daygreat rain showers,we stayed at the nobleden hotel for a short family holiday it is positioned in a great location with lots of restaurants on your doorstep the nearest subway is only a 5 minute walk. The hotel is great the manager is lovely and so welcoming one of the staff members was a bit grumpy maybe she was having an off day though the room was small but thats new york for you would have loved.

modern 10 blocks away from theaters and 5 from cental park 30 min walks to american natural museum  alciawe were very pleased with the hotel from the moment we walked in the door angela was the name

staff thank you very much park centralthis hotel is centrally located to times square and central park yet just far enough from times square to avoid some of the intensity of that location it is very convenient to the theater districtthe property is an older property but has been very welthe best thing i can say  it was some what clean the internet was horrible the staff was beyond unhelpful and rude bar doesnt serve any warm drinks like tea or coffee i will not stay there againmy first time ever in new york and i love this hotel great location and beautiful on the inside i was helped by the

especially quimby he has gone above and beyond to take care of our group the hwe stayed here for two nights on a holidaythe rooms are modern clean and well appointedi see some guests have complained that the view was restricted by scaffold due to external maintenance but to see new york is best to leave your roomthe services afrom the time judy  i walked in until the time we left the park central was definitely central to say the leastthe greatest location at the terrific all in one price including valet parkingroom was absolutely the best and cleanestwe would only stay ti have stayed at park central hotel in past years and it never disappoints literally minutes after checkin on my last stay in april i received both an email and a phone call from guest relations asking if everything was good with my room  it was  qubooked a standard room well in advance and having been there last year we were looking forward to our visit we opted to upgrade to a suite the suite was lovely sitting room bedroom and 2 massive bathrooms but sadly only about a foot of usable closetthis is our third time staying at the park central hotel our experience is always amazing the rooms are always very clean thank you so much ana kemi karim you made our stay worth it the location is also very convenient its only a few blocksemanuel at the front desk made sure that we were taken care of at all times we loved our stay due to his hospitality it was more of a home away from home thanks to him we celebrated a birthday to rememberwe were very glad to stay in this beautiful hotel it looks really nice the rooms are great and the location is superb near central park very close to the subway system and very near times square only drawback were the very steep prices for a glass othe staff at park central is just simply amazing very polite and professional and eager to assist every step of the way they go above and beyond the normal and has been the best experience out of a stay at a hotel location was better than i had anticigreat hotel with great people especially elsa and darren great costumer service central park is right up the street to we had a good time the trip through the airports and flight canceled were the downeri recently stayed here and used the valet parking when i got my car back they had stolen an old cell phone and a box of cigars that had been in my center console they had visibly gone through my glove compartment and center console when i called the has soon as we arrived on the floor where our room was located it reeked of beach towels exposed to ocean water the area behind the table lamp was dusty and the radioalarm was broken called the front desk to have it replaced but they never did the elpretty nice updated hotel in the heart of nyc tourist area i was taken aback by the fact that they added 35 to each day of my staya facility fee or something to that effect apparently thats common in new york pretty slimy imho the front desk sthe best things of this hotel are the location and nancy and q who work here they were lovely to us and tried to help in everything it is not easy to find people like this thanks guys bad side of it  i missed a lot of light in the room it is quiteabsolutely the best stay ive had in nyc the location is perfectjust a couple blocks from central park as well as times square easy access to the subway the hotel is beautiful and very clean the rooms are more spacious than any hotel ive staycame for a 1 night stay in july hotel is clean staff was nice however they need to address the ac system in the rooms we walked in to a hot stuffy room despite trying several times to reprogram the system to blow cool air it kept reverting to an athis hotel is great the location is a winner within walking distance of many a wish list including 5th avenue time square rockefeller centre times square etc the decor as you come in is immaculate and the staff at check are good there is a concthis was the second stay at the park central hotel in new york we had stayed at other hotels but came back to the park central because it is the perfect hotel for a visit to nyc the location in midtown has easy access to the subway central park timesthe service in this hotel is fantastic when we explained we needed our room and fridge till 4pm on check out day for our sons medical condition sokha immediately sorted it weve had a great stay with all our needs sorted staff are so accommodating afabulous location in midtown caring friendly staff rooms are clean and spacious id recommend this hotel for a great stay benny from security did an amazing job locating a piece of our lost luggage and went well above and beyond to help us out heana at the front desk truly went above and beyond to make my stay great she helped make my stay in this busy city like home i was able to check in early and leave a little late made my stay here greatit is my 6th time visiting new york city and this was the worst yet yesterday me and my family had a flight to new york from chicago after a 2 hour flight we wanted to checkin our hotel when we got to the hotel it was so noisy in the lobby they sailets start off by saying the one and only single positive experience was the 2 ladies at checkin they were great awesome personalities and very welcominghelpful where to begin i guess itll be simpler to just list them out room was a singdespite the primary elevators going out the stay has been fantastic guest relations especially quinby have been super helpful including an umbrella to help deal with the rain ive gotten multiple solid recommendations for places to eat within walkthe hotel is amazing super well centered absolutely loved the location the staff also but having the chance to contact elizabeth to help us out with our staying was so lucky she made our ny experience great again she helped us so much im so grafirst off the hotel charges a ridiculous facility fee i stayed there for 6 nights and the facility fee was nearly 250 that then pushes the cost of the hotel into another price tier and it just doesnt offer enough amenities to warrant being ineasy check in and check out clean room emanuel was very helpful with the check out great location to some local spots in times square i really enjoyed my time and will definitely recommend this hotel to more friendscame into town for work and a little leisure thanks to emanuel he told us about all the local areas vida verde was excellent i recommend it all the way the hotels service was impeccable more like a home away from homewe have stayed here for 8 nights and we really enjoyed it the hotel has perfect location is clean and has great service elisabeth in the guest relations was extremely helpful and provided some great tips eg the best bagels in the neighborhood ingroupon made a mistake with our booking dates quimby hightower told us we were on vacation and to go up to the privacy of the room to call groupon after more than a frustrating hour of being on the phone with them and mr hightower intervening it wasit was a lovely hotel at a reasonable price nearly filled with other evacueesnever making you feel like you are asking for too much and dealing with complaints rapidly looking really glad to see you thank you from the bottom of our heartswhen going to new york and if you need to stay in a hotel why not consider this one good location very clean very quiet very friendly great service and reasonable prices  for new york  but 11 for a sandwichfor me the location was ideal couple of min walk away from central park and times square subway station for both down town and updated it uptown right out side the hotel the hotel itself was clean and modern staff were friendly and even helped find awe loved our stay at the park central hotel the location is amazingseriously we lucked out on thathad no idea how good the subway is on the corner starbucks is just a few doors down times square is a few blocks one way and central park is a fethe location of this hotel was perfect for this trip it is right across from carnegie hall and a short walk to time square i have visited nyc numerous times and stayed in a lot of different hotels the rooms at this hotel are larger than normal which mwe opted to spend a little more on accommodation during our trip to nyc to avoid any nasty surprises and this one did the trick its well located easy walk from central park and time square and with lots of diners around the room was large and cleani recommend modernized hotel with great rooms excellent bed impeccable cleanliness very close to central park times be of and to major attractions in new york we stayed a week and we were happy awui the only point of attention to be prepared is w, park central is located across the street from carnegie hall 2 blocks from central park 1 block from broadway and about 6 blocks to times square this great location saves a lot of taxi fares many restaurants nearby starbucks next door. Hotel staff were very accomadating emanuel at the desk has great information to give only thing i ask is that carpets be cleaned better.
Pod 51 Hotel,our stay got off to a bit of a rough start when we got to our assigned room 911 the bathroom door wouldnt stay closed we were moved to a very spacious handicapped accessible room on the 5th floor unfortunately it was 63 degrees in the room fronstayed in the 51st street location on the east side great neighborhood with restaurants accessibility to subway and bus quiet at night most of the rooms are small pod so if youre going to nyc to sit in your room this might not be the best choicestayed last week for 5 nights in pod51 the room was very pleasant with a comfortable bed and excellent shower it was probably one of the smallest rooms i have ever stayed in but location makes up for this the subway is right beside the hotel with a migreat hotel in the center of manhattan it has every thing you need at a reasonable price along with all the necessary accompaniments you would expect from a hostelry staff are friendly and accommodating facilities are modern and practical well worthrooms are small but very clean and include all that one needs unless you need a bathtub  only showers when in nyc who needs anything other than a bed bathroom wifi and a tv otherwise you should be out enjoying all the city has to offer the podthe room was very good the toilets huge all the staff were friendly the walls are not thick so you can sometimes hear the noise outsidequiet and pleasant place near park avenue and other great placesive stayed in a queen and in a full both private bathroom overall both stays were excellent if your expectation is greater than a safe clean contemporary friendly comfortable place to sleep you might want to pay more and stay somewhere elseit is a cheap hotel but the bed is incredibly the shower is great the location is less tha 10 minutes walking from central station the staff is very niceso you have the best you need without spending too much the room is small but really decentpod hotels are for budget minded travelers you dont spend a lot of time in the room so some amenities are forfeited pod 51 offers free walking tours that are outstanding the attached restaurant is pricey for a budget location there is a tiny lobbythis is a perfect hotel for exploring new york the rooms with private bathrooms are tiny but have most amenities you really need  you just need to get used to the cramped layout if youre using it just as a base for exploring then it is completely fthis place is very clean the staff was great and the location was accesible i will definitely stay ther again the price is affordable and you could get to downtown ny or find a quiet and intimate spot near the hotelwe usually stay at this hotel when we come into town to work from la each month no frills rooms are small but efficient great location on 51st street

and minimalist room since didnt stay long and only used room to sleepthe large shower head was a plus despite taking a while for hot water once that occured my shower was fantastticthe pod 51 has definitely declined some since my last visit but it is what it is a small room to stay in while in nyc when you are here the size of the room doesnt matter much because you arent in the room much however the upkeep of the builnice place on manhattan for a reasonable price rooms are small but well designed so you dont fell crowded very modern hotel i liked glassy bathroom nice location at even distance to central park and downtownloved the pod hotel stayed here nye perfect location handy to times square and also the subwayrooms were clean and reasonably new excellent little usbpower bar near the bedsquite the hidden gem in new york should have stayed here for our whole trigreat location at midtown manhattan small but very clean room good price for manhattan there are many restaurants around walking distance to subway stations walkable to united nations headquarter building walkable time square central park grandif tight spaces bother you this definitely isnt the hotel for you this is my second time staying in a pod hotel i previously stayed at pod 39 and i was very satisfied with the stay the room at pod 51 was much smaller than the room i had at pod 39 bstayed here last week of november rooms very small but more than adequate great location very central and close to rockefeller center cheap had everything we wanted very clean as well would definitely recommendits all about the location and affordability with this hotel its very clean and comfortable the hotel and rooms rooms as you might have guessed are a little on the small sidebut as everyone says your not really in your room much as your out explive just returned from a 5 day break in nyc and did my research before choosing this hoteli had a queen pod with my own bathroom i had emailed to request a quiet room and thats what i was given it was a corner room with 2 windows on the 10th flowould stay again rooms are cosy bathroom was clean staff was very helpful conveniently located to many tourist attractions like time square central park 30 rock and the un building subway station close byroom just as advertised rooms are small but tolerable if you know what you are getting in to shared bathroom wasnt as bad as i had expected great location near subway and great restaurants and barslocation was excellent walking distance to many attractions like rockefeller center un times square there also also many restaurants coffee shops aroundthe hotel provides free guided tours during the week each day in another district the guides agreat affordable hotel if you just need a place to sleep off the beaten path quiet street and lots of bars within walking distance the rooms are small but very efficient staff is friendly and everything is very cleanwe paid 105 per night to stay in manhattan you cant beat that the rooms are tiny we stayed in the smallest one which has bunk beds a sink and a desk it is narrow its hard to fit two people in but we didnt spend much time in our room outside olast weekend shared a double pod room with a friend here  two double beds and a private bathroom for bargain lodging in nyc it is a definite possibility to be considered location in east midtown is great with subway access nearby and many chofor my sister and i it was a lousy experience this hotel resembles a dorm room more than a hotel they lack basic necessities after hours like water my sister got ill and at 2 am and i went to get her some water and had to get from a street vendomy other half and i stayed here for 3 nights during our trip to new york and i cannot recommend it enough yes rooms are small but its new york so what do you expect i was amazed at how clean the rooms and bathrooms were the beds were super comfythis hotel is very beautiful it has good services a good management team always seems to be working there communication way is also very persuasive the view of this hotel is also very attractive  it is situated one of the best place in new yorkrecently stayed here for a girls trip check in was quick and professional after checking out and making it all the way back to texas i realized i left my keys there i dealt with albert valdes in their security department and he is awesome he expeditthis hotel is really nice lobby is nice  clean and always smells nice when you come in only downside was the size of the room could not open the suitcase on the floor and shower is small but we didnt pay much so didnt expect much its a budgepositive nice clean quiet room fantastic location for walking to the main sights and close to the subway negative no coffee machine and coffeeno fridgethey had free walking tours which looked fantastic we had bought a new york pass so did our own thgoogle asks me why was it poor in reference to my experience at pod51 where do i start lets start from the beginning the attitude of the front desk did not respect us as humans being but as objects they can milk money from no greeting or professiovery good value for moneyvery good locationvery nice lobby pleasantly decoratedbeautiful roof well furnished with a superb viewvery friendly staffsmall rooms but very clean and quiet comfortable mattressonly one complaint lifts a little slowaccsmall rooms but clean and tidy  you dont come to new york to stay in the hotel front desk helpful and friendly shared bathrooms clean check out all of them on your floor as they vary in sizeoverall fab stayi really enjoyed staying at pod 51 the quality you get for the price you pay is very good the showers are not in the room but very clean the rooftop is amazing you can bring your own consumptionperfect location great hotel very accommodating staff what more can you ask for something was up with my tv when i got there and immediately shaun was quick to look into it trevor from engineering checked it out and turns out the tv needed to be cto be honest i was a little apprehensive about my stay at pod51 but i was very pleasantly surprised you cant beat the price for manhattan and the hotel was wellappointed and comfortable for being such an economical choice the rooms are small buti stayed at pod 51 with my boyfriend over new years and we had a great experience its a bit like a hotelhostel hybrid with some rooms sharing bathrooms but we had our own room the price was reasonable particularly given the holiday but our roomi stayed there for a few days while in town for business the location is extremely convenient and being able to be in midtown for an affordable price was an added bonus within walking distance from rockefeller center and broadwaylocated on 51st street east among a selection of small restaurants and in between more small shops and restaurants on 3rd and 2nd avenues the place is on the south side of the street there is a lot located nearby with quick access to both uptown and midthis hotel was really great overall but when i was checking out the man behind the front desk helping me check out told me i still had to pay facilities fees the man next to me checking out didnt have any and when i asked what those fees were forthe hotel has an excellent location near subway station and walking distance to most manhattan attractions lots of bars restaurants and food trucks nearby the area is completely safe at all timesthe rooms are small but comfortable and clean sharedi arrived with my son to pod 51 a week ago and stayed for 3 nights the best thing with the hotel was its roof patioveranda great place to hang around other things we enjoyed were the clean [small but totally ok] room nice beds i liked the musicme and my husband stayed here for 7 nights in feb 2019 and had a great stay fantastic location with bars and restaurants on your door step and good location to the metro we read some reviews about the rooms being small we stayed in a queen room and itlocated in the heart of manhattan 3 minutes from closes subway station in the close vicinity of nice pubs and restaurants 24hrs reception basic breakfast available not included in the price you get ekey easytouse and free of charge safedeposii stayed at pod 51 for a week and this was around the tenth time i have stayed great location with so many famous places to visit on foot and the uptown and downtown buses are on your doorstep as is the subway great places to eat and drink nearby be iwe picked this hotel for the location and we were not disappointed we were within walking distance of central park empire state building times square etc the room was clean and well presented yes it was smaller than most hotel rooms we picked a roomy flight was delayed 12 hours due to weather conditions so i searched kayak and found an affordable hotel for the time frame i called the hotel directly and was advised i could check in at 10 am i arrived at the hotel only to be told they had no roomsi travel more than 200k miles a year this is the worst hotel i think deep down they do not respect travelers and treat them as cheap people yes pod51 you made it cheap in and out will never come back,Stayed in the 51st street location on the east side great neighborhood with restaurants accessibility to subway and bus quiet at night most of the rooms are small pod so if youre going to nyc to sit in your room this might not be the best choicestayed last week for 5 nights in pod51 the room was very pleasant with a comfortable bed and excellent shower it was probably one of smallest rooms i have ever stayed in but location makes up for this.

i asked to move they gave meelegant simple and modern design with exceptional service the minute you walk in you will realize that there is something different and quite special about this place from the comforting music to the eclectic minimalist design elements right down to tso let me start with saying that we really enjoyed the hotel it can be a true city escape the amazing location the little details in the interior and the views from the rooftop bar but one thing that is even more important is well trained staffwwe stayed only two nights but we wished we should had stayed longer what a

is not for those lking bed was comfy and the room was clean the room is spartan but it had everything we needed for a one night stay we did not have luggage given the short stay it would have legit been difficult to fit a large suitcase in the room so pack accordingi would not recommend staying here for at least another year they really need to get their act together im writing this from a sister city room its a nice room except for the random bug we had to slay which is odd but okay for the 6th floor donei know for most of the people all rooms are not big enough for me was perfect i

bathroom great breakfast also good i would stay here againwe booked and paid  in full and in advance for 5 nights at this hotel in mid june via expedia we received an email confirmation the day before that arrival at around 8pm was fine on arrival  from cancun  were were told the hotel was overbooked anthis is the second time visited this hotel in the past 10 months and this visit was even better than the first comfy clean rooms and friendly staff there isnt a thing i can complain about when it comes to this hotel a lot of people complain about thwe decided to stay in the city following a matinee to see macys 4th of july fireworks because of the price and its great central location we choose this marriott while the rooms are small theyre immaculately clean and offer a small frig micstayed in the city view studio with 2 queen beds the room accommodated my party of 4 and the rate was fairly reasonable the hotel is a few blocks from broadwaytime square area quite a few restaurants within walking distancethey do not waste square footage in manhattan this hotel was a great location for us  easy to get to grand central station close to a couple of other subway stops and bus lines some good restaurants close by  a chickfila right on our corner we tomy mother and i stayed 5 nights the staff was excellent from check in to check out the breakfast buffet had a decent selection of food though the dining area was crowded overall our experience was very good big bus tours has a stop nearby on 5th avemy review is a little biased since we were traveling with 2 small kids the room was well appointed but obviously small since its in the city the location is phenomenal close to everything the free hotel breakfast is nice but very crowded and canas always this is an account of my personal experience with this hotel and may not reflect every travellers experiencewe arrived at jfk in good time from manchester after a problem free flight with virgin altantic the queues at immigration are long angreat location to midtown happenings staff was friendly  efficient room was adequate size and clean i didnt try the breakfast but it looked like the offerings were par for this brand the bed was comfortable and the room was quiet i think itsthe springhill suites midtown is located minutes from the empire state building times square and penn station it is not a huge hotel and is missing things like a restaurant that you would typically find in a larger hotel but it is very comfortable andwe picked this property because we were using marriott points and because it was one of the few hotels that has two queen beds in a room we couldnt reserve the two queens when making the reservation but we called 24 hours before we arrived and they wepretty good for the price no major complaints but nothing was great either location is convenient the hotel is new and clean rooms are tight but have a work areadesk small fridge and microwave ive stayed at two other springhills however in canice mid priced hotel in new york city within walking distance to madison square garden penn station empire state building and restaurants small room but clean and comfortable good breakfast and friendly service recommend billy joel concert at thewe booked late and stayed on points so didnt have great expectations but we really couldnt find fault a friendly welcome with lollies a clean and good sized room and a decent free breakfast a real plus was how quiet the room was too having sti have stayed at this property twice with my most recent stay in from may i chose this hotel for the location understanding that it is a limited service hotel but its a good value with the complimentary breakfast some of the in room amenities includethe room and beds were clean and fine the free breakfast and coffee were good too helpful front desk and convenient midtown location are also positives criticisms 1 the frosted glass bathroom door doesnt afford enough privacy if somebody is in thethe hotel is situated in a great location in manhattan our hotel room looked over the empire state building which was an amazing view the hotel itself was extremely clean and the maid service was good the rooms are a little basic looking but have everno frills is right yes you can get a good deal here and the location is ok depending where you want to go trains are all a 510 minute walk no subway really close you can walk to macys and the empire state building easily times square is about ai believe that this hotel was a good value for our money id done my homework so i had an idea what to expect i know the rooms would be on the smaller side and the bathroom would be small they were and that the bathroom might be not far from the encustomer trip  great location right by penn station and the garden great view of the empire stare building great breakfast spread very friendly staff parking next door and a great discount from the hotelfree breakfast excellent location friendly staff rooms arent very big but probably bigger than a lot of them in nyc price was fair as well you could easily walk to all the tourist locations only a few blocks from time square macys is right arounthis hotel is pretty basic but was perfect for our stay in new york location is great for getting around and the rooms were comfortable breakfast was ok nothing flashy if you like a fancy plush hotel this probably isnt the place for you but if you donlooking for a new venue after our airbnb cancelled meant we were frantically trying to find somewhereluckily this place turned up on our search and what a stroke of luckwith the empire state building 2 blocks away the location is perfect for everything i checked in and it was really pleasant my room was freezing so i called down for some blankets after about a half hour i got one but it was not very thick so i called down for another one and they brought me a comforter and another blanket finalamenities not up to marriott standards breakfast was ok but left unattended rude staff that does not know the meaning of hospitality location 3 blocks from subway station we enjoyed nyc but wouldnt recommend this hotel when there are so many to choohere for a night checkin very friendly quick plus easy care of car thro valet parking nice clean rooms comfortable beds and precise temp control breakfast was average given they seemed to be running out of stuff on a busy saturday morning very fstayed here with our family of 4 the rooms are a great size for 2 people but just a bit tight for a family of four 2 teenagers the room was quite beds comfortable and everything was clean breakfast was yummy be sure to go early to breakfast becaustayed in a double queen view is the best thing about this hotel room is ok size for nyc good heatac you control yourself good noise insulation from other rooms bathroom set up was poor frosted door meant anytime someone went to use the bathroom ai cannot say enough good things about this place and it staff one small story i left my purse in the lobby area one night around 1100 pm it was in a public area and many guests and staff would have walked past it we discovered it was missing early tgreat hotel great locagion shoft walk to broadway and fifth avestaff very friendly and professional when we arrived room had great beds and pillows shower good rooms clean and the size expected for a city centre hotelbreakfast was bonus again good stthis turned out to be perfectly situated for us off of 5th avenue we were able to get to many of our destinations walking or a short walk to the subway the rooms are a little larger than most nyc hotels in this price segment the staff was very friendlwhere should i start the staff at this location made my long term stay as comfortable as possible they knew my nametook care of my packages and took care of any issues immediately the rooms are a little smaller than what im used to but its locateda great hotel right near herald square the rooms are a little small but they are designed so well they feel much bigger and have everything you could need for your stay our room was so quiet we did not hear anything all night  everybody who works herethe location of this hotel is perfect  it is about a 1015 walk to just about anything in midtown the included breakfast is good but crowded our room was nice two double beds

Staybridge Suites Times Square - New York City,my partner and i have just returned from a long weekend in new york and stayed at this hotel i booked this hotel due to its good reviews but since that point had noticed a few negative reviews which concerned me i neednt have worried everything wasthey gave us a horrible room first day and after a long debate they agreed to change it next day the rooms are outdated and you need to wait for around 20 minutes to take an elevator they made several mistake in room charges as i was overcharged severagreat hotel rooms were clean and comfortable beds were very comfortable breakfast was good location was excellent and not too noisy staff in the hotel were very helpful and welcoming would recommend as good value for moneywe chose this hotel for its proximity to times square it is an easy 5 minute walk to get to all of the action its a little sketchy feeling on the block near the liquor store but we never encountered any issues the hotel room is a standard size roomdelilah at the front desk was so quick knowledgeable and helpful she gave a wonderful first impression and made us feel welcome on top of that all of the staff were helpful with a great sense of humor the rooms were nice and if we had a problem bgreat location in times square across from port authority for easy walking to any shows and easy access to subways for everything else rooms have nice kitchenettes with apartment size large frig stove and microwave warm breakfast and nice little gymnot only their roooms are all you need to rest in a city that never rests but also its people makes the difference they are out out of this world starting from jamemonet who when hes not taking care of any detail is playing drums and guitar at thewould i stay here again yesthe good things nice outlook from room great to have the full size fridge to stock up on things comfortable bed great location near all the restaurants on 9th avenue walk to everywhere from this central location great horooms are clean and bonus have a small kitchen which is handy the laundry is great and although the elevator is slow it didnt bother usthe breakfast had a good selection and the waiter andy always had a welcome smile as did all the staff location is vnothing much to recommend this hotel other than its location reasonable price considering but it was a big booking for a business trip for several people the lobby area is usually full of people mostly waiting for the 3 incredibly slow elevators servvery bad reception and conciergedoorman need to focus on customers in front of them not helpful to me at allthree lifts but long wait at the lobby as it can be crowded walkway is darkonly plus is free laundry for guests 5 washers and 5 dryers avawesome hotel great location  near all the attractions  parking in area safe but pricey room clean and well appointed beds comfy and clean the price is good and staff is great room service is fast and greatright location in the heart of the intresting areas friendly staff well equipped quite room this is a really well managed hotel apartment and hotel the breakfast was very nice and rich even the elevators were fast enough the laundry in the ground lwe had an amazing trip to new york at the end of january we booked to stay for 8 nights and the overall stay was really good friendly staff clean and functional i had read the reviews before leaving and was a bit concerned however i neednt have wi know the title wots this got to do with a hotelwell when its a trip for ur boss ooops wife to go mad shopping in the big apple u better have the rite hotelwe have stayed before and to say its a little tired is about rite but and its a bigroom looked run downtv channels were not workingvery poor stafflack of knowledge and simply rudeamounts deducted from credit card which i dont know for whati cannot recommend this establishmentarriving at the hotel literally dripping like drowned rats my husband and i had not even checked in yet and were already cranky when our kids at home called to announce the house was flooding that could have set the tone for the weekend but for the outhis hotel is extremely clean and the rooms are welldesigned we got a great deal for a january trip and it is in a great location walking distance from the bus terminal times square and subway stop i take off 1 star for the elevator wait times asi found all the front desk staff very friendly and professional ricardo and shereen were very pleasant and most helpful andy from the breakfast area was very pleasant and helpful the elevators lifts took a long time to arrive as there were issues mywe booked 7 nights at this hotel but in fact forfeited one nights fee by not staying at allthe room described as a suite was tiny with kitchen facilities squeezed inthe lift to get to our room was very slowfirst time ever ive turned tail on a bookionly just got around to writing this review stayed here 14th till 20th dec and i cannot believe the negative reviews ive read about lifts  food rooms bathrooms air con etc etc our stay was first class rooms were adequate bonus being the littlethis hotel is very basic but we were just looking for a moderately priced hotel for a large group with a good location calling this hotel times square is stretching it hells kitchen is more accurate it was a decent walk to times square we hathis hotel compared to all others in new york was cheap and included a great breakfast and was very centrali stayed here with my 10 year old daughter hotel hotel is centrally located  near time square and 2 different metro stations that we found verythe rooms are not soundproof we were able to hear clearly someone speaking on the phone in another room or people passing by in the corridor and we were on the 16th floor yet we could hear the noise on the street when you wash your hands in the toileti recently stayed at this hotel because of reading the wonderful reviews also hotelscom had a fantastic rate i regret ever choosing this place it was so bad that i had to make a listhere goeswe reserved a studio suite with 1 king bed to call thismy teenage daughter and i stayed at this location during a quick trip to the city to see some shows and take in sites it was a wonderful location to base camp out of the theaters and central park area were all within walking distance rooms are clean aloved having the kitchenette with full size fridge had every utensil you could think of the bed and shower were amazing the location was great walking distance to times square and 1 pizza very close byreception people not professional at all with attitude specially front desk manager karim not helpful at alli would like to thanks them for the way they treated me while i had a problem no sense of humour at allthe hotel is situated just off the main times square area but is a short and convenient walk to most attractions the bus terminal across the road provides easy access to other ny districts including buses to the woodbury outlet mallhotel itself is a biwe have stayed here before and loved it this time there were a few glitches but overall i would still recommend first the positives you get a free breakfast you have a full kitchen the rooms are clean the beds are comfortable now the glitches thwhile the hotel was passable especially for nyc our trip was almost ruined by the long lines waiting to use the elevator it took up to 20 minutes if your room was on a upper floor one elevator out of three was out completely and when it was repaired swe check in this past saturday not thinking anything and excited to spend a day exploring the city with the family we get into the room start getting ready to leave and our kids are explorers like all children i come out of the bathroom to see my son hthe rooms are clean breakfast is decent and plentiful the hitel staff  including front desk and housekeeping are all helpful and kind jamie was playing guitar in the lobby and he serenaded my parents for their wedding anniversarywe where on the top level of the staybridge hotel which was the 32nd floor  we had 2 queen size beds 2 chairs a nice bathroom  a little kitchen the view was lovely but we couldnt believe we had this room as i had booked it 3 days ago through bookquite big rooms its all getting a bit tired but not threadbare or anything and thats reflected in the price yes the lifts are a problem at busy times the included breakfast was really good staff were really friendly and helpfulthe location ishotel is easy to get too if you are driving into the city the location makes it easy to walk over the city breakfast was good staff is very friendly but elevators are hard to catch in the morning and evening i would recommend staying if you are wantiwe have stayed in many hotels all over the world this must be one of the worst hotels we ever stayed in and how this hotel got a 45 rating we very unsure of we travelled the usa for 4 weeks and this was the most disappointing hotel by far and was ourwe booked a king suite as it appeared from the website to be a nice well equipped room with enough space to chill out on the period between chasing around new york and going out for dinner the suite is just a regular hotel room with a small cookhad a wonderful stay at the staybridge suites time square new york booked a room with double twin beds the room is very small which is typical for nyc but the room was clean free breakfast every morning which was great the breakfast had variety andwhat a nice surprise very conveniently located to times square and subway entrance is right across the street breakfast is well put together and plentiful plenty of staff on hand to keep food available and tables cleaned off as soon as someone gets upwent with 39 other people 34 teenagers the staff were courteous and respectful even though the kids were well behaved we took up a lot of room at the lobby and they were patient with us the rooms were very comfortable would have given them 5 star byes there are so many places you could stay in new york city in fact it could give you a headache researching all of them to find just the right one or you could try a different one every visit but this one was well worth returning to again knowingwe have just left the 32 storey staybridge suites near times square for 3 days of our 3 day stay one of the elevators did not work they did not call anyone into fix it we walked along with many others down stairs 27 floors to breakfastthe rooms arei booked this hotel and got two twin beds that were plenty enough for us each to have our own bed conveniently located to everything they had a all you can eat breakfast in the morning and fresh coffee close to all of the shows and convenient to everywe booked the staybridge suites for ur trip to new yorkthis is ur 3rd time heregreat hotelgreat staff very polite and friendly the restaurant staff are very helpful and very cheery as breakfast starts at 630 nice and early to make to most of your dstayed here 8 nights of a 6 week family holiday to the united states great location fantastic hotel with all the comforts of home elevators a problem but cant be fixed dont let it ruin your stay front office staff could be a little more attenwe are thoroughly enjoying our stay 7 nights and cannot thank nor recommend jamie enough for his time entertainment and interaction with our children in the lobby during this time just amazing we would love to return as we enjoyed his music so muchmy husband  i stayed at staybridge suites times square  new york city 418  423 5 nights we paid 167626 our reviewarrivalcheckin we arrived between 78p on a thursday  were greeted by a very friendly representative monae she mentionedi am a great fan of the ichg group and stay 90 of the time in their hotels but never in this one againin defence of the hotel this is a busy easter weekend but that is no excuse for some of what we facedfor what we paid i have used before a nice hotelhotel was very clean and good location walk to subway and times square with in minutes i was surprised how large the kitchen area was in the room would recomend and stay again next time only bad thing was the elevator situation only 3 elevators forstayed here for one night for business travel the staff at this hotel are excellent very welcoming and helpful the newness of the rooms and beds seem to be reasonable for a hotel at this price and at this location i thought it was nice that they offethe hotel is ideally located 10 minutes walk from times square rooms are comfortable ask for high floor but be patient in the morning to get an elevatormanager has been responsive to our demand king size bed and high floor despite a bad start thits a convenient location to stay but the hotel has seen better days the rooms are clean and spacious but the decor could do with an refresh not sure which is slowest the service at reception or the elevators but both are equally frustratingjust come back from a stay here we were very happy all the staff we encountered were very friendly and attentive it is a great location with a subway right at the end of the street and next to the port authority bus station so if you are flying into ny a,great location in times square across from port authority for easy walking to any shows and easy access to subways for everything else rooms have nice kitchenettes with apartment size large frig stove and microwave warm breakfast and nice little gym. not only their roooms are all you need to rest in a city that never rests but also its people makes the difference they are out out of this world starting from jamemonet who when hes not taking care of any detail is playing drums and guitar at the hotel.

time working at the boxing at msg taken care of brilliantly by andrew and the staff hotel is perfectly located easy to get around and massive rooms by manhattan standards thank youmy stay at the stewart hotel was mixed i was already skeptical as i found out just before my stay that the reviews on their tripadvisor website were fake i travelled with my family and we booked a room with 2 beds for originally 7 nights after 2 freezstayed overnight for the pink concert at msg right across the street  super convenient while our room wasnt the room we chose online we went to the front desk and was so happy to meet christina who made sure that our stay was the one we hoped for shewe come to nyc often for boxing event this is without a doubt our favourite one even when promoters make arrangements elsewhere we switch it up and stay here right across from the gatden insane balconies this is the biggest one ive seen but iti just stayed here for 2 weeks in a studio with kitchen the positives are my room was not available for my whole trip but i upgraded my room and they kept me in my same room instead of having to change not sure how that changed from booking to stayingexcellent customer service and very proffesional staff andrew checked us in at the front desk and he was very pleasant i will deffinitly come backthe hotel room was very clean too and it just made the trip more comfortablecurrently staying at the stewart hotel in a one bedroom suite great location we have walked most places and penn station is just across the roadcheck in was fast and simple after a long flight from brisbanemelbourne room as expected a little dated bandrew at the front was great helped us out with a great corner room being a historical building the room had interesting features conveniently located and shockingly  we didnt hear much residual noise from the city maybe that was our room and fthis place is amazing the staff welcomes you like family and the location cant be beat even more so this time i met the manager andrew daly who provided a personal touch that you just dont find at most if any hotels definitely takes the sthe stewart continues to be my goto hotel in nyc in large part because of the staff on my last trip andrew and khan at the front desk were particularly helpful in straightening out my reservationweve stayed at the hotel stewart 6 times and it never disappoints everything about this hotel is 10 out of 10 doormen are friendly and helpful the desk staff rocks theyre professional problemsolvers anything you need help with ask them roomswe had an issue with the previous hotel we booked so i needed to find another place to stay last minute im so grateful i found stewart hotel and from now on its always going to be my first choice andrew at the front desk was outstanding he helpedfirst room had water all over bathroom floor 2nd room had wall air conditioner falling apart and terrible mildew smell 3rd room was functional but all rooms demonstrated signs of disrepair paint peeling caulk over caulk over caulk to fill defects innot for the faint hearted  get your walking shoes on and prepare for several miles a day  if you get taxis there expensive and slow when traffic is really busywe found the standard of hygiene in 90 of cafes and eating places not clean enough standardi reserved through hotelscom a room for 170 it looked great and the hotel had pictures off a balcony which i thought would be great to see the city night lights when i checked in i realized that some rooms have a balcony and some did not mine did nfrom the moment i arrived jenny at reception was incredibly kind and helpful after arriving on a red eye they gave me the first room available to get some quick rest and clean up before meetings the room was surprisingly large for nyc standards i ext,i stayed here for one night with my family in midjune and will not go back my kids 6  3 were traumatized when the smoke alarm in our room went off in the middle of the night. i wouldnt have felt ripped off if i had paid double what i paid the room was cleaned and made up everyday all the staff were very friendly and helpful and we were given a free room upgrade on arrival. this will be my now go to hotel at all time.
The James New York SoHo,the hotel is great in all the ways that count clean great service but the extra touch was an awesome dude named eric working there apart from just being a nice guy to talk to for a few minutes he gave me great and most of all honest recommendations ti am not sure where to beginthis place is amazing and with a professional staff and a great atmosphere lets begin with the staff a huge shoutout to yuon sasha mavis christina shefi johnni and even the pool boy michael wow what a team thehad another amazing stay at the james soho the location views and rooftop pool at this hotel are unbeatable hotel staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and we could even talk to the front desk via text message will definitely be backcool location modern good food well meaning staff but this hotel is not at the top of its game room was not well policed before i moved in toilet missing a part front entrance is not well staffed took 2 days to notify me that i had a fedex delivegood location but difficult to get to due to oneway streets and limited parking room are very trendy but a little small bathrooms enclosed by glass and it limits privacy in room nice staff but you have to navigate bar patrons trying to get to rooftopwe travel to nyc with some frequency and love to stay in the soho area so thought we would give the james a try it is in an excellent location has amazing rooftop views the beds are very comfortable and the heated bathroom floor is a definite bonusthe james soho is a conveniently located stylish modern hotel you can walk to the west village greenwich village downtown lower east side and many subway stops my wife and i are walkers so the location was a huge plus for us if you want to shopit was a short trip and unfortunately did not take advantage of all the amenities sad however the room was really nice and the heated floor was an awesome touch the only issue i had with the room was the lack of visibleavailable plugs they were bulove the james soho it is a beautiful hotelthe amenities are great and gitanos is such a fab addition definitely recommend if youre looking to stay in the soho area if youre lucky bobby will be at the front desk to assist youhes a gtraveling for business but brought my wife along for evening in the city the staff here was amazing the bellman down stairs i think kenny and wayne could not have been friendly and helpful we unfortunately had to drive in and they brought our car upgreat week at the hotel staff accommodating roof top was the extra treat with great views music and staff rooms are spacious enough some rework was done on the top floor and the gym needs some attention but overall great stayangelique and leslie were so very helpful when i stopped them to ask for information they were kind and helpful and i was so thankful for their kindness even when seeing them again in passing they made me feel so welcome and at home what a great expethe hotel is very well situated but it has a big default and it was a big disppointement  the roof top and the pool close very early 2pm in the we and 4pm in the week for parties when you have children and teens you have no access its really a pitin the heart of soho ultramodern and fabulous the roof top has a great lounge with little pool room are very modern clean and light the lobby are is very nicely decorated and offer computers coffe and snacks i enjoyed my stay very muchwe reserved the penthouse suite for my husbands 50th birthday the music system was not working as there was no adapter we wanted to invite friends over but we were unable to play music so there went our birthday party they finally put an adapter iwhen we arrived we were immediately greeted by johnny and bobby we had such a wonderful check in experience these guys were extremely genuine and helpful they made us feel right at home we were given an upgrade which was completely unexpected but hthe hotel looks nice on the inside and the views from the a penthouse are breathtaking however they may still be completing construction renovations as a loud disruptive noise kept us awake also the food service is slow and of poor value if you cannice place very clean professional staff affordable and within walking distance of several great places to eat and shop roof top bar and pool are very nice pool is a little small but wasnt crowded nice views from the roof top bar good drinksi regret not reading through other reviews outside of fivestars lucky enough to receive nightandday service from what we felt was very absent service and terrible valueas others have noted experiencing our main issues were sound price value andthis place is a mess unorganized not clean check in process is a nightmare nobody has one clue as to what theyre doing they do not change the beds daily its overpriced the lamp shades are falling aparti had a great time had a great night and invited friends up to the pool for birthday festivities highly recommend drinks are expesnsive breakfast included with my stay was not noteworthy  but i otherwise had a great timeour corner studio had nice views of the one world and was surprisingly quiet despite us being only on the 5th floor the setup of the rooms are nice and i always prefer a hardwood floor over carpeting the room itself was just showing wear and tear bati stayed for one night and was upgraded to a room with an amazing view the hotel gets the little details right with complimentary water in the room and coffeescones in the lobby the staff is also great  especially bobby who checked me inpeople are clearly choosing the james soho for its location and great par rooftop pool and they are right the bar is really cool and so is the rooftop during summer location is also very good in the middle of soho near cool restaurants and shopsthi was so blown away with my stay here i found the room to be decent sized for ny with great views the location is awesome with access to the subway and the greenway i didnt get a chance to try the onsite dining but there are some great food options ndishonest pricing with initialbooking and final billing same goes for breakfast included we did exactly what they said and ordered the breakfast they offered but they only comped part of it that was not explained the price is not worth the quality atthe staff here is amazing and so welcoming from the moment i checked in to getting extra wine during their free happy hour their staff is so friendly the beds are super comfy and the rooms are nice and updated there is even a facemask in the mini barexcellent location with luxury amenities rooftop bar and pool staff friendly and accommodating complimentary coffee and snacks all day complimentary wine served 2 hours in the evenings nice

side but its soho and the room has everything you need restaurant on site doesnt really match with the hotel but its nice rooftop is beautiful but best part ofdisappointed stay with poor service no effort to make client happyvery small gym room for such a big hoteleven no umbrella while it was raining and the personnel claiming the management knew the day before that it will be missingamazing and surprisingthe service here is exceptional but the rooms need to be completely renovated we were woken up at 800 by banging on the floors in the room directly above us which is ridiculous why we were put in that particular room to begin with it was a wednesday nfantastic hotelstaff very exceptional and friendlycheck out the roof bar jimmyswont be disappointedgreat locationbar food at jimmys also tastyeasy walk to local bars and restaurantsgiving a true feel of the non tourist new yorkfantastic hotel great location excellent value for money would definitely stay here again and recommend to others friendly staff who couldnt do enough for you checking in process was very easy very happy with my overall stayrooms are ok the hotel overlooks a very busy road hence traffic noise in lower rooms and upper rooms have very loud bar  you get charged a 40 facilities fee each night which is a hidden cost and apparently to cover free coffeewine thats offered earli had 3 days here for work it was a great location lovely rooms most of all the staff were incredibly helpful special shout out to yuon who helped me print stuff and generally made me feel like nothing was too much for him i will definitely stay htook my wife into the city for her first mothers day natalie and her team rolled out the red carpet and gave her an incredible vip experience it was very relaxing and such a wonderful

my bags 1010 would stay againthanks guysm,the hotel is great in all the ways that count clean great service but the extra touch was an awesome dude named eric working there apart from just being a nice guy to talk to for a few minutes he gave me great and most of all honest recommendations ti am not sure where to beginthis place is amazing and with a professional staff and a great atmosphere lets begin with the staff a huge shoutout to yuon sasha mavis christina shefi johnni and even the pool boy michael.
The Leon Hotel,centrally located hotel with friendly staff close to public transport and within walking distance to many attractions the rooms are very clean and tidy only downside would be the traffic noise has great air conditioningloved the leon and would consider staying again as i loved the location being minutes away from little italysoho the les and the financial district not to mention the restaurants of chinatownwe booked one of the loft suite style rooms as we were with ofirst time in this city overall cant complain location good location considering the size of new york there was ammenities close by and 2min from manhattan bridge which has incredible views of both manhattan and brooklyn price compared to other hotmy wife and i stayed for one night  we saw it as a convenient stay for onward travel to next morning cant fault the location in terms of its vicinity to many attractions but but i have to say it was extremely noisy we must have got about 23 hours slthe hotel reception staff are all rude with the exception of nadia the manager is ignorant and unhelpful the room was lovely although we stayed for 9 nights and whilst we were given clean towels everyday the bed linen was not changed the rooms werewe booked a suite of 2 rooms  and 2 bathrooms for a recent 4 night stay with our daughters overall a comfortable hotel with generous sized rooms and fantastic views over manhattan bridge  the beds were the most comfortable ever and so welcome afterleon hotel is a good hotel right in the heart of china town room was clean comfortable and spacious we did have a room with 2 double beds plenty of places to eat nearby and a short stroll to little italy subway is 2 blocks away bd lines walked tgreat place to stay super friendly staff and nice clean and spacy rooms we were fortunate to get a view towards the arch and manhattan bridge front desk booked car service that worked spotless and had a friendly driver we even forgot a pair of newlythis is our favorite place to stay in nyc each year we stay here for a week during thanksgiving the rooms are clean the view is great its close to what we love about new york its just our placereceived a great booking confirmation from the hotel to ensure everything was in place staff couldnt have been more helpful during our stay recommending places and giving us tips room was spacious and clean although the coffee machine was strange andblink and you walk past this place and miss a little gem in manhattan in the heart of chinatown and a short walk to little italy you are surrounded by great food choices a short stroll away for the subway for easy travelling around the city or a walk ajust spent 6 nights here while visiting new york for the first time located on edge of chinatown and little italy opposite manhattan bridge grand st subway is 5minutes walk with b and d trains taking you uptown canal st subway 510minutes walk withthe hotel is right in the middle of chinatown newly remodeled room and super clean guest service also was excellent samantha was showing me where to go and gave me tips in the area she also let me know that i could check in early it was 1pm since tclean comfortable and quiet everything we needed for our stay in nyc room is a good size and while it could maybe do with a picture or two to cheer it up it had everything we needed the beds were extremely comfortable the bathroom was modern no shthis was a nice and cozy boutique hotel within chinatowncleanliness  everything was super clean we had no issues whatsoever the bathroom was spotless sheets were crisp and white no stains on the carpet i am very picky when it comes to cleanlinessthis is a beautiful little hotel modern and immaculate with a very helpful friendly staff youre in chinatown a couple of blocks from the subway and an easy walk to little italy in reality you can be anywhere in new york in about a 12 hour or lesswe needed a place to stay one night for a short family trip to nyc after searching on tripadvisor and reading reviews we decided to book the leon hotel it was a good decisionwe usually stay in the times square area of the city but this time we hadthe good rooms are big modern and very clean they are the same as seen in pictures rooms were very quiet didnt hear any noise from other rooms or outside we stayed in room 203  bathroom is big shower had good water pressure bed was comfortableif this property had functioning wifi i would have gladly left five stars unfortunately the wifi  when its not dropping out  is about as fast as dialup which makes it impossible to use any apps for work such as skype or virtual meeting programstayed here for a recent college visit to pace university which was an 8 uber ride away this hotel is really in the heart of anything lower east side its in china town near the financial district and all the other points of interest and business iwe booked this hotel a year in advance after seeing it on holiday pirates the reviews were all good at the time of booking and still are to this day the price we got was excellent for nycjust checked out of the hotelthe hotel is based on the edge ofonce upon a time there was a lady who had an emergency and needed a place to stay after a particular unfortunate event on my last day in the city that never sleeps i found myself with a medical emergency that prevented me from going up the 5 floors atwe stayed here for one night to attend a concert at the bowery ballroom and i am thrilled with our choice first of all hats off to the front desk staff because they were nothing short of fantastic our girl nadia was super sweet professional and just ai would stay here the next time i come back harlem bridge is just right there when you walk out right across the street is this noodle place subway is a few blocks our room was modern and had a great view 5 starthe hotel was excellent for what we required clean rooms comfy beds and a functioning bathroom theres nowhere to get breakfast or food at the hotel which was fine because as a tourist i was happy to have american breakfasts at diners or where everfirst i will say that i painstakingly took a long time to pick this hotel so many hotels to pick from in new york city i read reviews about this hotel which mentioned the great customer service so finally went ahead and booked this hotelwhen we checthis is a very clean modern hotel that is well managed existing in the middle of chinatown means everything around the hotel is chinese restaurants etc the hotel doesnt serve breakfast so finding a neighborhood place is difficult the recommended pthis was our second stay in the leon and again it turned out to be a good choice new york is not cheap when it comes to hotels and this one meets our needs without being too expensive i say it is a no frills hotel and by that i mean that it does not hathe hotel was ok kind of expensive 300 usdnight for what you get there are no good breakfast cafs close by so we usually combined breakfast and lunch somewhere elsethe worst thing was the wifi the reception looked ok but when i tried a skype meeive stayed here twice the previous time was in september 2015 just after the current owners took over the hotel frankly its starting to look a bit tired lots of chipped furniture surfaces damaged by hot drinks and food  these are small things thait was literally a series of problems from the get go we arrived at 240 pm and told our room was not ready yet ok i get it checkin is at 300 but i have never been turned away when it was that close to 300 and apparently no room was ready ata nightmare to find we struggled to find this hotel so did the 2 taxi drivers and locals we asked once found we were a bit concerned with the scaffolding round about which covered a lot of the front the receptionist was a bit rude at checking in it wits the second time we stayed in nyc we chose this hotel bc is had a good location foodwise close to east village little italy and chinatown our stay couldnt have been better clean hotel comfy bed soft sheets big room to nyc standards close tgreat location great price great staff and great room the best way to move around the area is by subway i would come back to new york and this hotel but i will be wearing a pollution mask the city and the underground subway are too polluted and i da terrific hotel for families on a budget good location that gives easy access to anywhere in the city via subway rooms were clean comfortable and well appointed definitely recommend staying here for your time in the big applewe were 3 friends 60yrs young staying inhotel leon for 4 nights we booked a suite which gave us 3 double beds and 2 bathrooms one bed and bathroom can be partioned off with sliding doors the rooms each had a coffee machine safe and hairdryer there wthe hotel is nice and clean rooms are comfy most importantly its nicely located just around the corner of soho little italy china town and the financial district all in walking distance grand street subway station at 4 milehotel couldnt be more close at manhattan bridge with chinatown  little italy just around the corner all of lower manhattan  like 0911 memorial or wall street  can easily be reached by foot subway is just a mere 200 meters away from the hotelroothe family room i had booked was just big enough for the 4 of us the beds were just wide enough for 2 the bathroom was small the room was clean but had an odor the hotel does not have a lot of facilities the lobby has 2 chairs in front of the elevatgreat location right next to china town and little italy overlooking manhattan bridge short walk to brooklyn and new area of dumbo very nice front desk my room was a corner and windows were huge giving a great view especially in the evening also ththis hotel is a gem located in the center of china town at the base of the manhattan bridge while i have no love at all for china town the subway stops are close a five minute walk to most and the area feels very safe the hotel itself is exactly wthe rooms were good decent clean rooms nothing special but we were not looking for fancy good location to chinese restaurants and little italy the hotel was covered in scaffolding which made it difficult to find especially at night as the scaffoldingwe were 5 girlfriends staying in the family room which has two full bathrooms perfect for us the location is just on the edge of chinatown which means its so close to lower east side and soho  perfect location if youre into bars restaurants and shograde in mid between 3 and 4 but i gave 4very comfortable mattress and pillowspace in cabinets to store itemsclose distance walk to subwaynice view of the brooklyn bridge entrance structureclean towelsgood ac good heaterfresh bathroom very poi was going to stay here but after they charged my card a full week before i was even due to check in i cancelled i called the booking agency and told them what happened they then called the hotel and told them it could be up to 15 days for my refundgreat hotel great location price is outstanding hotel is clean and staff was super nice our room had an awesome view of the manhattan bridge arch i had reservations about staying here because i didnt know the area and the price was much more affordthe leon hotel did not disappoint situated in chinatown its walking distance to worthwhile ventures like little italy and 911 memorial the room was nicely done with a comfy bed and great rainfall showerhead the room was smallish but all we needed ivery nice hotel friendly staff and easy check in the rooms are spacious and my kids loved the view of the bridge out our window some of the furniture looked a bit worn but other then that very pleased with the staythe leon hotel is youre lower east side hotel just down the manhattan bridge in the heart of china townrooms are bigger than average and the shower is just great far better than so many hotel showerseasy acces to all over manhattan and brooklyi would absolutely recommend the leon hotel for a budgetconscious traveler and especially a family looking to stay in manhattan for the price i dont think you can do much better unless you snag some amazing promotion hotel leon met all our needs on the edge of chinatown the leon hotel is convenient to also little italy the lower eastside and many other attractions the rooms are comfortable and clean the in room keurig as well as the wifi are greatly appreciated the staff if friendly helpfi booked this hotel as a one night stop over before moving in to an air bnb and actually wish i had stayed longer the room was a really decent size and the location fantastic the east village is a fantastic neighbourhood but it is really noisy and thisthey dont tell you there is a popeyes fried chicken situated on the ground floor of this building right next to the entryway of the leon hotel in chinatown the entire place including the upper floors smells like stale fried chicken and its prettya double room with two separate beds superior double at leon seemed to be rare in nyc this was one crucial criterion for us and we were happy with choosing leon service was good they for example changed our room because you could smell smoke in the,centrally located hotel with friendly staff close to public transport and within walking distance to many attractions the rooms are very clean and tidy only downside would be the traffic noise has great air conditioningloved the leon and would consider staying again as i loved the location minutes away from little italy soho the les and the financial district not to mention the restaurants of chinatown.
The Lombardy,we had a great experience at the lombardy our one snag was that we were told that we could check in after lunch but it was 345 before we gained access to the suite which was a bit difficult with two young travelers in tow however once ensconced in ounot at all as advertised cannot believe they charge what they do for this place i checked out the same night that i checked in last minute booked a different hotel entirely because the condition of my room was in such shocking contrast with the imageat almost 400nite before taxes this was an expensive hotel for us but it was a short luxury trip to manhattan celebrating our anniversary the lombardy is on 56th street between park and lexington only a few blocks from bloomingdales in one directiowe have stayed at the lombardy for several years now forsaking the regency for additional comfort and more personalized attention the staff is great rooms are comfortable and feel like home location is the best  we walk everywherethe lombardy in new york in midtown east 56 st between lex and park is a great location for visitors the hotel offers condos which are large apartments that have kitchens so families can enjoy a meal in their room if you are a couple the king studiowhat a disappointment this is not so much a hotel as hotel theater  a company pretending to be running a hotel the staff was completely indifferent  desk clerks the socalled concierge who doubled as the bell staff so was not available to any apprwhat a find lovely hotel and great location they upgraded is to a huge suite beautiful big room huge comfy bed 2 bathrooms and kitchen with huge lounge area on the 5th floor not a great view but didnt mind as mostly out it was great to come back tthe location is excellent close to many nyc essentials the room was a good size but with the detail of not having a night table on the right side rooms are comfortable but dont expect nice views from them the other aspect that needs to be improvedmy first stay for two nights at lombardy was excellenti had no idea that this old residence hotel was actually redone i had a beautiful quiet modern room i definitely wanted to return i booked two back to back reservations one for four nights onegreat customer service wonderful spacious room our unit was decorated very nicely separation of spaces was nice location is convenient to all we wanted to be near breakfast was included great serviceok my wife surprised me for our anniversary with a staycation in the city she booked us a room at the lombardy and it was great nice room and so close to our favorite restaurants but the hidden gem was in the lower lobby the salon specifically thelombardy was a nice surprise its walking distance from park avenueand severalother usefulplaces like whole foods cvs etc a bit of a hikenothing unusual by nyc standardsto the cebtral park and empire state building and severalother places touthe hotel has large comfortable rooms and suites at affordable prices great location if you are on business excellent service this will be our hotel of choice for the future trip advisor is making me write more to get up to 200 characters ithought bour

professional we paid 459 a night before taxes i founthis is the first time we have stayed at the lombardy and were extremely pleasedfrom our accommodations to the staff to the foodall 1st rate and reasonably priced everything is within walking distance to mid town will definitely stay here fromwe stayed at the lombardy for five nights during our visit to nyc for my wifes birthday i had stayed here before and remembered it for its great location large individual rooms the hotel was much as i remembered it the location is excellent for walwould come back because close to the fair i have to work the lobby is not as grand as you might think but the room was okay just okay well a bit more then that but not awesome i guess it depends a bit on the price up to the 250 it is okay for whatwhile our room no way resembled the photos online we decided it was charming it was dated but comfortable and quietit was easy to get to all of our destinations from soho to the cloisters from this locationthe staff was amazing all members of the stgreat location good hotel but the rooms were a bit old and random we had a good nights sleep and it central to everything it is pricey for the quality of the room no closet and iron in the room all in all it was goodthe location is good  in proximity to central park and to 55th avewe came here two times during our total trip  the first time

they were quite patient and professional in their interactiothis hotel is located in the prime center next to did h avenue and central parkthe hotel does not have too many amenities however very clean and well kept the rooms are spacious and we always enjoy our stay at this hotelthe rates are quite reasonablwe had an excellent experience staying in the lombardy hotel located in 56th st east of park av good location we had been there before with a not so good stay because we were given a suite not large enough for three people since we had an adult daughthis is a really good little hotel that is part hotel and part corporate apartments its between park and lex on the eastside the rooms are fairly big but can be a little outdated the street noise is pretty low except when trash day comes there isduring our 5 night stay we experienced a lovely attentive staff at the lombardy the location was perfect loved the valet parking our spacious one bedroom suite on the10th floor was newly renovated and served our needs for sure unfortunately we hesitagood location bad  elevator major delays only one elevator available for 18 floors no stairs available uncleaned rooms poor breakfast assortment the positive is comfortable locations and rooms kind and friendly staffwe stayed for the holidays and we really enjoyed the staff is very nice and we stayed in a large room with 2 closets excellent location the stay includes breakfast but need to be improved no fruits or cold cuts  only scrambled eggs and few choiceswe have been staying at the lombardy on average of 6 times per year for both

got this hotel at a good price  amazing staff rooms are huge and well kept perfect for our stay which as being nyc wasnt going to be in the hotel long  breakfast was lovely catered for all only thing to keep in mind the hotel restaurant is actuawe spent five days here and were bowled over by the size of the rooms for midtown new york which usually are very small we had a king suite which was basically a large room with a small kitchen this was exactly as we had requested and was perfectenjoyed hotel and location bathroom could use some updating but room was clean bedding was very comfortable breakfast was good and wellserviced however the american rock and roll soundtrack was a little loud and jarring first thing in the morning wwe stayed at the lombardy hotel last week and it was the best stay so far in nyc we were greeted by the most courteous staff at the reception specially abeer soliman she was very welcoming and polite we were given 12 an hour early checkin and they amy husband and i stayed at the lombardy hotel for 7 nightsfirstly the location is excellent  it is a short walking distance to many shops eg bloomingdales and victoria secrets and eating places there

emailed requestthank you staff are great and very helpful and friendly only bad comment which seemgreat staff great location one of a kind rooms for nyc i really appreciated finding them and staying in their hotel well above in the other locations in nyc where i usually stay well recommended i received an early checkin and it helped me accomplisugly room very dark on the 6th floor of the buildingin the immediate vicinity of the elevator whose noise night and day was added to that of the archaic air conditioningnote that one of the 2 lifts was down for my three days of stay so longer

home you can be sure we will be staying here again and againoverall great experience staying at the lombardy the location is good and the rooms are excellent rooms are good size and clean the hotel staff are helpful and friendly the wife and i would not stay anywhere else while in nyci visited nyc with two friends we stayed in 1604 a lovely up to date corner suite with a galley kitchen a large living room and a king bedroom the living room had a pullout sofa so it worked perfectly for usthis room is at the back of the hotel and youd think it would be quiet but there was loud noise coming from exhaust fans that ran throughout the night difficult to sleep also there was no clock in the room i called the front desk and they said theythis hotel comprises rooms owned by different people and therefore no two rooms are the same we had a room with a lovely king size bed small kitchenette microwave fridge plates cutlery etc table with two chairs lounger side tables large tv lstayed here

is a favourite pla group of us meet in nyc for a weekend once a year and we go to different higherend hotels the lombardy was our first stay and we will definitely go back again it was wonderful cant wait to returnwe had a wonderful suite in your hotel we would love to be staying there longer the staff were very friendly and helpful the bedrooms were very spacious and clean the location was perfect we could walk to all the sights in midtown i will recommend,The lombardy is on 56th street between park and lexington only a few blocks from bloomingdales in one direct. The hotel offers condos which are large apartments that have kitchens so families can enjoy a meal in their room if you are a couple the king studiowhat a disappointment this is not so much a hotel as hotel theater  a company pretending to be running the hotel.
The Townhouse Inn of Chelsea,i almost dont want to write this review because i dont want the word to get out we stayed here for a bachelorette and we wanted the cozy feeling the inn was perfect and shocking to even know this place existed in manhattan eric was friendly and accoearly october we had the great pleasure of going to nyc on vacation usually it can be a rather expensive and disappointing experience as hotels in the city can be overpriced and often low standard but at this occasion we found an affordable place withthis place is very well located very close to 6th ave and to the subway which means close to everywhere located exactly between time square and greenwich village a lot of good restaurants nearby including the famous eatalyit is an old townhouse cthe townhouse inn of chelsea is sort of a new york city anachronism its a 14 room inn that melds a hotel and an airbnb experience those are hard to find in manhattan especially considering its prime location any airport is a mere one or so hour disthe townhouse inn is a fine place to stay location is perfect for uptown or down with all translation options close and accessible our spacious room on the w 23rd street side had a very comfortable bed and ann endlessly fascinating view at all hourswe rented a suite for three of us two queen beds and were happy room was large and nicely decorated

boutique hotel in the heart of chelsea it was very reasonably price and overall we enjoyed our stay we stayed in a room with a king bed and it was huge for manhattan it was more of a suite withgood

from two subway stops and so much to do nearby i went for three nights with my two daughters and we really loved our clean and homey little room we had no real view but i appreciated the quiet at night itwe had a lovely stay at the townhouse inn just before labor day 2017 you cant beat the location it is 2 blocks away from 4 subway lines and right near the flatiron building and madison square park there are lots of markets and shops in the area thewe recently spent four days in nyc to see a show the 911 memorial and what was new since our last visit for a change we decided to stay in chelsea and based on excellent reviews we booked a room at the townhouse inn of chelsea it was an excellent dpeaceful and well run establishment very roomy and spacious room and attached baththe inn is located at a great place and was ideal for me to walk down to wherever i needed to get toall the people responsible for running the inn are very friendly athe goodthe hotel has a great location breakfast was very nice quaint furnishingsthe badvery noisy the windows that face 23rd street need to be sound proofed it was very difficult to sleep with so much noise there was black mold in the bathroom gthe townhouse inn of chelsea was enough clean enough quiet enough close enough to things we were doing enough for a night or two the desk staff was very helpful there were plenty of options around for breakfast and shoppingthe staff were incredibly friendly and went out of their way to make me feel at home delicious breakfast and anything you want dog friendly i will definitely be returning as reasonable prices too they got my dog from the car when room was ready and pwe spent a weekend and loved the hospitality and warm homey feel in this quaint and charming little inn we have been to new york many times and usually stay in large hotels but the townhouse inn of chelsea is a great alternative to those the staff toeverything about the townhouse inn was great the rooms are eclectic but large and comfortable the breakfast was excellent bagels breads fresh fruit yogurt etc we had room 33 3person room and 34 4person room both were great as long as 2 peowhat a gem of a findcancelled flight had us looking for another hotel for 3 nights we managed to get in here for two of them very nice hotel spacious yes spacious room tastefully decorated communal breakfast area also very impressive bed comforti love this place the location is fantastic and the rooms are lovely but most importantly the fine art of service remains intact at this gracious inn eric and the team make sure that everything is ready for you  in your room and in the exquisite li had a nice large room at a good price and the inn is in a fabulous location if you want sleek chrome room service and a health club do not come here if you want a large room with funky charm then you will be happy here the continental breakfastmy wife and i stayed here last thursday this is our favorite place to stay in chelsea it is more of a bb than a hotel the manager eric welcomed us and let us check in slightly early though we just asked to only drop our bags off we were greeted bygreat little place and very quaint and clean booked it on expedia which was a big mistake as very strict 30 day booking policy could not shorten our stay by one day due to medical reasons though 28 days out we called  tried calling but the policy hadwe enjoyed our stay at the townhouse inn at chelsea beautiful old townhouse mansion converted into an inn but retaining the old city charm nice spacious breakfast room with tasty continental breakfast each morning all the rooms are spacious and nicelythis is certainly not a shiny modern 24hour manned boutique hotel but that was one of the reasons we chose it the room we had at the side of the hotel overlooked the adjacent empty church which made the room a bit gloomy during the day but at leastlots of positives about the townhouse inn the rooms were definitely bigger than typical nyc hotel rooms and we heard very little street noise since this is an old townhouse it has a lot of charm to itthink of shabby chic furnishings and some interi would have had only nice things to say for the townhouse inn of chelsea had it not been for the lock failing on the front door on a friday night at 1am that forced me to find another hoteli spent the following 25 hours after getting locked out tryintownhouse inn of chelsea is a gem of a hotel its really a bed and breakfast inn with spacious clean rooms unlike anything youd typically find in new york the room we stayed in featured exposed brick walls and a quaint old style decor withstayed for 2 nights on a quick stop in nyc from reservation to departure we enjoyed the pleasant personalized service of this unique inn our room was very spacious with zero street noise r53 excellent access to the subway  busses situated betweenup until we checked in things appeared to be finei emailed eric ord general manager and asked if we could leave our luggage there we arrived early until 3pm when we would be able to check in eric graciously said no problem when we arrivedmy friends and i were in nyc for a concert and decided to stay overnight i found this gem in the heart of chelsea small bb clean beautifully decorated friendly staff and very good security beds were comfortable continental breakfast was fresh andmy wife and i have travelled to nyc before and stayed in larger hotels this inn was a far better place for us to stay very quiet immaculately clean and charming place the owners are very helpful and friendly very good location as well we highly receasy check in and out awesome location and easy access to every part of the city from here room was dated but we think it added to the overall charm of the inn itself easy to keep to yourself or mingle with other guests at complimentary breakfast sareasonably priced for nyc near two subway stops and lots of restaurants comfortable delicious breakfast with juices coffee tea milk bagels pastries muffins breads fresh fruit boiled eggs oatmeal cereals granola and more gave a good start ti cant say enough positive things about my experience at the tic if you want a typical hotel stay then dont book here i would describe it as bnb meets new york apartment meets staying with friends very quiet in fact i didnt see or hear anyonthis place is fantastic i love that it is a small operation lots of caring touches you wont get at a hotel i love the charm of the old building the interior brick is amazing i would definitely stay here againthanks to eric for the welcome the directions advice the umbrella the interest in our visit and for hailing us a taxi in the rain and carrying our bags this place is what i would call shabby chic old world but a bit worn comfortable and clean fthis small bb inn has delightful personality and character having done extensive touring in europe we have dubbed this the rick steves hotel in chelsea it has wonderful access to the subway system and is located in a comfortable safe neighborhood tovery cool lodgings huge rooms quality continental breakfast in a lovely library settingwe spent 6 nights at the inn and would recommend the accommodation to all except those who want totally modern rooms in a sterile environment eric and his staff arthis inn is located quite centrally on 23rd st between 5th and 6th avenue the 1 train that will take you south to battery park or north to times square and central park is at the end of the block  so thats just perfectthe hosts are very nice they ar,Townhouse

WestHouse Hotel New York,the westhouse is a fabulous hotel everything from the rooms being kept so clean and tidy to the up to date deco the staff is just amazing everybody that works at the westhouse is great i just want point and exceptional bunch of people that made ourmy husband and i had very pleasurable stay at the westhouse its always a wonderful experience we loved how close it was to everything we love to walk to central park and broadway excellent customer service we want to say thanks especially to thethis hotel is stunning and right in central location you can walk right into times square broadway even central park on arrival we received a bottle of champagne and had complimentary ghd hairdryer and straighteners was a lovely touch the room wasgreat hotel clean and friendly rooms that we stayed in were nice and clean small but to be expected in new york and a little dark but overall nice the breakfast and happy hour were great lots of choices and everything was greatgreat location alsoa true luxury property with every amenity imaginable and a staff that delivers sincere concern for guest comfort since moving out of our cps apartment and trying cp area hotels we have finally found a home for those traveling on business you can havei organized a group stay at the westhouse working with the reservations team specifically suzanna and su was an absolute breeze they responded quickly to all of my many requests changes and additions in the most professional and kind manner everyothe westchase is a fourstar hotel in a twostar building with three star service issue really poor climate control in the rooms like other old buildings in nyc you either get heat or ac in good hotels they have made updates or figured out how toi have booked flights and 3 nights at westhouse hotel via opodo all fees included and all payments were done in advance double room with breakfast i certainly accept local citytaxes but at the checkin counter they asked friendly but strict for anothtravelled with my husband daughter  granddaughter excellent hotel with a fantastic greeting from the staff on duty our rooms were ready on arrival  were perfectly clean on the 20th floor no complaints about either rooms take your travel kettle ifwhere to begin i came to the westhouse hotel in celebration for my 21st birthday my boyfriend at the time used to live in new york and we knew itd be the perfect place to be for this pivotal moment we had visited new york before and stayed in the janthis place is just shy of getting 5 stars the resort fees are 49 per person per night its nice that you actually get something for this here the breakfast is a nice way to start the day the wine and light snacks from 57 is a nice touch the bottlethe west house hotel is by far the nicest place to stay in new york city the location puts you in a great spot close to transit in a safe area near times square near rockefeller but not too close where its too busy not only do they have countless amlocation is fantastic so is breakfast which is included the rooms are quite nice but a bit tired but would probably recommend this as a good stay in the city near the park shopping and restaurants with pleasant staff and a boutiquey feel to it sadeverything was absolutely perfectand the hours of indulgence from 1700 to 1900 with nice food and good drinks was an extra value for money the room was nice tidy and clean and we could open the windowswith no noise from the outside what a lovely warm cozy elegant retreat from the chaos of times square ive stayed here multiple times always having a clean room and comfortable bed and gorgeous rooms but this time the service was even a step above kind polite and warm staff frnyc is expensive breakfast lunch dinner drinks a bottle of water a cocktail  you will pay more for these things in nyc than just about anywhere else in the world therefore when a hotel offers a big breakfast eggs meats potatoes pastries baghappy hour between 57 great  could be 58 like some other hotels who offer this  overall  room nice cosy and clean little bit of noise from latecomers chattering and slamming doors in the early hours of the morning but on a weekend i suppose to be ethe hotel is well appointed and other than room doors that bang shut which will disturb light sleepers this was a great midtown pick melida in f  b and rafael during wine hour were good humored and attentive even with more difficult guests the breajust got back from my first trip to nyc with my daughters and stepmom this hotel is wonderful clean high level of customer service and food for breakfast and afternoon appetizers is wonderful would stay here again just a couple of blocks from timeswe just spent 6 days at the westhouse hotel what a lovely place

flight and a dreadful ride to the city from jfk arriving at the hotel at midnight there was kathy to greet me she was warm and welcoming the hotel charges a hotel fee for the breakfast and indulgences in the evening this minor cost isfabulous hotel in a great area you have plenty of options down and across the street central to time square and a few blocks from central park plenty of stores to visit while walking down the street good room late check out the service from the stanyc is known for great service but westhouse team really take it to the next level highly conscientious staff that

good desk are hotel rooms on higher floors so quiet for nyc front desk and concierge staffwe would expect a five star hotel to not have maids carts stationed permanently in the corridors as its

2 adjacent rooms ive got to say that this was exactly what we were looking for its a high quality relaxed hotel with five star quality but non of the stuffiness that you might expect it feeli could

raphael at thwe really enjoyed our march 2019 visit to nyc and our stay at the west house first of all the price was right our room however was very small and we asked for an upgrade we got one for a

The hotel is stunning and right in central location you can walk right into times square broadway even central park on arrival we received a bottle of champagne and had complimentary ghd hairdryer and straighteners was a lovely touch the room wasgreat hotel.
YOTEL New York,our room was run down the pictures are really deceiving i could not stop laughing when i first entered the room  it was so small our outdoor terrace was filthy  would never use the day bed or hot tubthe rooms are nice great bed great shower nicely modern and clean the foyer is too busy and loud and they are now charging for a lot more than they used to its hard to find a quiet space to relax its all very full onwe went in the middle of summer every single floor was out of ice then we were asked if we belong on floor 25 while we were checking for ice i had to request new towels every day but they were nice about it everything else was good people werethis was our first visit to new york  we chose the yotel due to its location and price the checkin computers are very smart and we had no issue getting our keys then off to our cabin the room is exactly as expected cosy and compact but full of alleverything was perfect the location the comfort and cleanliness of the room and the friendly staff was on point could not have been more pleased i would definitely recommend to others and stay here againplease be aware there is a 35 per night facility chargethiscovers wifi gym and business centre i was notmade aware of this by my travel provider so wasshocked when i wasgiven a bill of 200 on checkoutthis is not just any hotel while i want to recommend everyone to this amazing hotel i think i want to keep it a secret so that there are rooms available the next time i am in nyc  i look forward to visiting the other yotel properties on my travelsnice place but be aware of the resort fee added on when you evaluate the price which is 35 the rooms are small but everything laid out to make the most of the space it is a half mile to the subway and convenient it is very cleanthe bill amount and the amount yotel charged on our credit card do not match the invoice stated that its us8032 for 2 nights but yotel charged us100 on our credit card no email reply at all for the issue besides the facility fee per day you alwarningyotels prices dont include the resort fee for me this was over 40 per day which made what seemed like an acceptable price end being over 200 extra this completely defeated the purpose of paying for a smaller and less luxurious room companice option nice location good service nice views good price i really recommended this hotel is more than the another regular and traditional hotel is cool and nice at the same time very cleanwe chose this location because mr leslie jordan was performing in the green room 42 located within the hotel excellent show and we went to nyc specifically to see his show parking is below the hotel our room was premium queen view on the 20th floomoney earning have lots of hidden charges not money friendly will charge alot after you check out traumatic for us costumers its was a good hotel but will charge you with facility fee of 80 and you have to pay if your want to leave your luggage forthe cost of the room was a bit high after the resort fee but thats typical for manhattan especially in this part of towneverything worked and was relatively clean except that when i went to turn the bed down for the night i accidentally pulled backtrendy hotel a few blocks outside of times square staff and service are fantastic bed is comfortably firm with position adjustment cabins are tight and storage is minimal room was clean and cleaning staff was thoroughvery cool hotel with friendly staff great location within walking distance from times square bars restaurants theaters and many attractions i loved my cabin style room on the 25th floor very clean and a very comfortable mattress i slept like a bawas very apprehensive staying at this hotel after reading negative reviews i have to say i was pleasantly surprised location was great rooms where compact but had everything you needed and enough space for storage enjoyed the food on the terrace ourthe location area near times square a great restaurant area near the bus terminal and train stations wonderful sightseeing area and shopping area price was within nyc prices a great gathering place for friends and familycool hotel near downtown very good price and perfect for a quick business trip all the automation gadgets make it interesting although not particularly practical anyway it is a great option for a short stay in couple or by yourselfif you are looking for a modern hotel that has many features not found in traditional hotels this is the place for you great location cool robot luggage storage very nice employees adjustable bedsofa very clean hotel highly recommend great valuenot very pleased the photos do not match the experience itself the lack of amenities for all people staying there is disappointing wish i had known before booking staying in a room that doesnt even have a coffee maker or fridge not for me you cantsuited for a younger couple not as big as i thought but i should have known and did a little more research would have liked an updated tv it was really slow bed was comfortable and the shower was great didnt like the nonprivacy as much view waswhile the facilities in the hotel were not the problem interacting with the staff there proved difficult they appear to have no communication with the staff at the door of the hotel downstairs which means deliveries and birthday presents simply vanishnot enough value for my money since there was no breakfast included no room service options horrible toilet setup in the room no vent the staff did not respond to my emails up to 2 days after i sent it neither my chatthis hotel was beyond disgusting the shower bathroom area was dusty and filthy and the tissues looked used additionally my bed had yellow stains so fresh they were bleeding through the sheets on the bed my tv was broken when i reported this inforthis is not a location for older couples blocks from subway cabs and bus available overall futuristic theme was silly internet iffy telephone unfunctional i will say staff were excellent friendly other drawback was lounge and restaurants cannot cmy husband and i stayed in ny overnight before our cruise embarked and found yotel to be more economical than other chains beautiful property extremely clean and very comfortable much quieter than i imagined it would be since we were in the city easdont rely on the websites pics of the rooms and amenities  they must be several years old the room had stains on the carpets stains on the sheets ripped towels broken faucet dented furniture and chipped paint everywherelove love love im from upstate but when im in the city i always see this hotel its so cute the bed was so comfortable the guest was so nice and the people that work there parking garade was a plus liquor store was a big plus lol i will be back sooenjoyed our no frills stay great location easy walking distance to theaters and uss intreped  asked for a fridge to refrigerate some perishables and was provided a small 6 pack sized model which worked but dont expect to fit much in itthis hotel is very different from many i have stayed in in nyc had no problem with the kiosk in lobby that dispensed room key fast and efficient my room was about the size of a walk in closet that being said it was so strategically designed that i rthis hotel is a bit out the norm  but not in a bad way the rooms where clean and well maintained everything you need  would recommend to family and friends and would return central for everything plus plenty if delis and convenience stores on the dthis hotel tries so hard to be cool that it actually makes itself dumb they have these stupid sensors installed in their rooms which will turn off all the lights if they dont detect a person now the location of their restroom is such that the sensori gave them a 4 because i liked the hotel but its really like 3 12 total green hotel  not luxury no doorman no individual shampoos the rooms are really small but good for 1 person or a couple i got the terrace room which was much better for astay at your own risk we just stayed over the weekend and our friends room was robbed we typically like a yotel we stayed at the one in boston the hotel itself is clean and in a great location unfortunately when we returned from a night out our fwe loved our stay at yotel location is perfectthe service was great and i had a really nice experience the rooms were all you need clean with a great view of manhattan id stay there again anytimethe employee at the front desk started cursing because we asked him to change our room ben the concierge was rude and demanded money for storing our luggage this was an informal charge no taxes no receipt we did not pay what he demanded so he did nattended a show at the javitts center yotel was located close by making it a good choice for that i had previously stayed at yotel close to it first opening this visit was much different at least for the room i had it doesnt seem like any upkeep hadcame to nyc to for a weeklong vacation location and availability on the dates we were interested in was the primary reason we have picked this hotel the place advertised itself as a state of the art hotel rooms which was a bit of a concern but hgood hotel and perfect central location rooms not very big but clean and comfortable breakfast not included but for an extra 15 dollars available for 15 dollars a really good breakfast nice roof terracechose yotel because it look great and the location was convinientthe room at first sight looked great but once inside there were a lot of little cover up jobs and scruffs the shower door didnt closelots of noise in corridor in the morning and my roomif you are doing business at the javits center this is a 7 minute walk it is perfect if you are two people look for the larger rooms very clean and good vibe the terrace is perfect for networkingthe employees in the terrace are not friendly and the security team cant make decisions the rooms is way to small and toilet is open space with the room which makes it uncomfortable if you have some one with you in the roomcabin looks old not really clean bad smell next to the toilet noisy in the hallway the state of the room is less and less cleaned needs renovation work in the room especially the shower seal showers were too oldroom is ridiculously small no amenities unfriendly staff my privacy kept being invaded people kept coming into my room even though my do not disturb sign was up unknown hotel staff was trying to come into my room even though i said nothe rooms have all that you need and the location is perfect for going to times square the upper west side central park and chelsea the room was clean and there is a food emporium right across the streetdecent average clean clever room design air conditioning not great good location average comfort nice shower and sink room not cleaned one day butworth the price for the location great restaurants in the areaended up being a great venue for a wedding the terrace and bar area was great but the rooms left basically everything to be desired literally the tiniest room ever with non existent service no literally they try to use robotswe usually take the train to nyc but decided to drive because yotel is conveniently located to the lincoln tunnel and highway reasonable overnight parking rate for nyc modern and efficient hotel breakfast buffet was adequate not a lot of choices forgreat hotel good bar and food rooms were clean and a reasonably comfortable great shower lovely comfortable bed the maid was incredible and so friendly all staff were helpful and friendly and always willing to helpyotel is well located close to time square 10 minutes by walk the robot at the entry will take care of your luggage thats really cool the service is tiny with few people to help the quality of service is horrible they arranged a taxi for me to gthe location was great but our room needed some serious updating we had no blackout or privacy curtains had no towels or soap in the room for our first full day and the outlets literally fell out of the wall when i unplugged my phone charger we werelet me start off by saying i plan trips months in advance with that said maybe you can see where im coming from unlike the manager on dutytomo i reserved one night at yotel back in february through expedia and then in march i booked and paid forthe service was great although it costs a little extra for breakfast storage of luggage and so on but i had a really nice experience the staff was very friendly and extremely service minded the luggagecar service personnel the reseptionist and the,our room was run down the pictures are really deceiving i could not stop laughing when i first entered the room it was so small our outdoor terrace was filthy  would never use the day bed or hot tub the rooms are nice great bed great shower nicely modern and clean the foyer is too busy and loud and they are now charging for a lot more than they used to its hard to find a quiet space to relax its all very full on.
