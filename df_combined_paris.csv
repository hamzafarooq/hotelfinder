Hotel,all_review,summary
25hours Hotel Terminus Nord,weve spent lots of time in paris and this was a quick trip such a fun cozy welcoming spot we wish wed had more time there our room was palatial by paris standards and very quiet and comfortable no complaintscentrally locates and new hotel very good breakfast and room quality centrally location just outside gare du nord and the metro friendly staff with nice bar and insite restaurant and within easy walking distance to other interesting areas in paristhe hotel is pretty but the service standard seem to have been established by an 18 years old trainee on the day of our checkout the housekeeping staff knocked and entered the room 5 times successively starting at 9am all the way until 1230pm very shortterm memory this goes against hotel standards whereby hsk is informed of the room vacancy by the front office once the guest has checked out  on a side note the elevator is extremely slow and antique  highly recommend giving up and using the stairs instead  also in 2021 in covid era there are still no contactless checkin in place which you can imagine becomes quite problematic on a saturday when the front desk is only equipped with 1 staff goes back to poor operations standards and processes  but again the hotelfinally a real hotel with comfortable rooms excellent breakfast and common areas just in front of the stationpaying a bit more you can get larger rooms featuring a balcony very handy for smokers we had a perfect staythe hotel is modern and slightly quirky the room was adequate size but not overly big it was furnished with a comfortable bed and desk a hanging rail for clothes but not a wardrobe   the bathroom was clean and had a good shower tv wifi and mini fridge  close to the station for trains and metroa very pretty hotel with awesome interiors our room was slightly cramped despite going for a medium plus but on the whole it was fab the staff were friendly too  the only issue is the lift can take a very long time to arrive and we were told there are no stairs apart from that greatwe were blown away by this excellent hotel we stayed in the hotel for 3 weeks because we did not want to take any risks by staying with our elderly family members full disclosure before you read on we benefited from a long stay rate  we absolutely loved it   the room are great clean comfortable with big windows  the staff is incredibly helpful from giving us a tea kettle for our stay to helping me find my misplaced wedding ring we thought was stuck behind the headboard they went above and beyond what we would have expected from hotel staff  this hotel is also dogfriendly a rare thing to find in paris our dachshund was beloved and we really felt at home during this tumultuous time   the location is ideal if you arrive in paris by train gare du nord is verythe hotel is pretty but the service standard seem to have been established by an 18 years old trainee on the day of our checkout the housekeeping staff knocked and

tumultuous time   the location is ideal if you arrive in paris by train gare du nord is verythis hotel is excellent  its location right opposite the gare du nord was highly convenient for eurostar  our room at the front directly faced the station and we enjoyed sitting on the balcony admiring its grand architecture  all that wonderful sculpture  our room was very comfortable and the decor was interestingly quirky  excellent and quiet airconditioning too so we slept very well  the staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble  the new manager was charming and enthusiastic  he permitted us to leave luggage there after checkout and to continue using the hotel facilities  we intend to return next time in paris  it was a real treatgreat hotel with really friendly staff fun quirky rooms which make great use of space even in the smallest room   great location just seconds from the eurostar   only suggestion would be to install some international sockets and possibly to replace the light switches with something less confusingdue to a mountain of online bureaucracy in order to return to the uk via eurostar we had to stay overnight in paris  this hotel was recommended by a helpful staff member what a find clean comfortable very eco friendly with a super restaurant  i couldnt find a fault lovely helpful staff on the desk and in the restaurant  i plan to return when less harassed highly recommended and opposite the station for an early train journey perfectwhile it may not be as entertaining as other 25hours properties this one is certainly the most convenient as it sits directly across from gare du nord so if you have an early train departure or flight from cdg via rer b this hotel would be a logical choice however it doesnt have as many fun common spaces for the guests to simply hang out while the hotel does feature a requisite neni restaurant that serves sumptuous breakfasts and great dinners and an adjacent plush hipster bar it offers few additional amenities such as lounges with comfortable sofas or mini libraries for the guests to browse but then again you are after all in the middle of paris and the metro is literally at your front door it may be wrong to be wasting your time in a hotel no matter howthe hotel is modern and slightly quirky the room was adequate size but not overly big it was furnished with a comfortable bed and desk a hanging rail for clothes but not a wardrobe   the bathroom was clean and had a good shower tv wifi and mini fridge  close to the station for trains and metroabsolutely loved this hotel right by the station so great for people arriving by the eurostar the room was a good size with a lovely walk in shower perfect for a 3 night stay  the decor is also really funky so great for picture opportunities we had a continental breakfast one morning which was nice lots of food to choose from the service in the hotel was fantastic the guy who worked in the bar called william was very friendly made us lovely hand made drinks and gave some great recommendations  would defiantly go backfantastic hotel pictures do not do it justice all staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome especially md on reception such a friendly yet professional person the best personality to have at front desk will be coming back to stay when we are next in paris thank yougreat quirky hotel decorvery modern young staff excellent with fleur a star supervisor location perfect for eurostar arrival from the uk and the metro outside the front door was able to check straight into our room at 930 ami loved this hotel ive  traveled all over the world and this has to be my favorite one thus far great staff awesome location walking distance like 50 feet from all public transportation i hope to return again one daycolourful world of cultures in the midst of the 10th district of paris the 25hours hotel terminus nord is located in the heart of the city and really one of the best hotels that i have stayed in parisi booked this hotel for 4 nights and because of the us travel ban my girlfriend and i had no choice but to leave after only 2 nights i emailed the hotel manager to see if i could either get a refund or credit for the 2 nights that i did not stay there and they outright said no  first of all this hotel is not in the best neighborhood in paris and everything is a 20 to 30 minute walk  with all of the hotel choices in paris this is not a great place to stay25hours hotel terminus nord is a hip hotel that features vibrant and stylish rooms the interior design is unique and colorful the hotel also features magnificent facilities that provided us the muchneeded comfort and convenience while we were the city 25hours hotel terminus nord also has a strategic location it is situated directly opposite the gare du nord train station making the hotel an ideal starting point for us to explore paris  we stayed at a large plus room with a balcony facing the train station it was a hotel room like what we wanted for this vacation in paris the balcony has the view of the street and gare du nord the room has a kingsize bed and other thoughtful amenities  our two nights at the hotel was a pleasant stay to remember we had a stylish room3 nights spent here last weekend and i will definitely be back  everything about this hotel was great the staff the room the cleanliness the wifi the breakfast and the location   i cant find a single bad thing to say and wouldnt hesitate to recommend  revisitwe stayed here for a long weekend in july 2020  this hotel is only seconds from gare de nord and so was in a fantastic location for our eurostar arrival and departure as well as for getting metro and rer trains around town it is also only just over 5 minutes walk from gare de lest station we are huge fans of the 25 hours brand and regularly stay at hotels in the chain and this one lived up to our expected standards despite the weirdness of the covid precautions we got a deal that included breakfast and the food and service were great our favourites  were guacamole and also the omelette which we got in addition to continental style bread and jam and pastries really friendly staff at reception the theme style and decoration of the hotel is a bit eccentric but overallvery convenient location great concept and atmosphere in the public areas we really liked the room with big and comfortable bed our baby spent also a great night there breakfast was really good too we will come back   thank younot my favourite 25hours of which i know but ok location in front of gare du nord is a bit rough and loud but this is not influencing my review because its not the fault of the hotel and it is convenient when you travel with eg the thalys train the house in which the hotel is located is very beautiful   corona rules make sense and are easy to adapt except that you can not leave your luggage there that does not make sense and you could organise this without contact to the customerluggage i assume its a manpower saving measurement  but why is service at breakfast that slow and understaffed even if the house was not full that makes no sense and is annoying the employees are really very nice and helpful and thats also not nice for them because customers getthe 25 hours hotel terminus nord was the perfect place to start and end my trip to paris i travelled on the eurostar from london and it is literally across the road from gare du nord station so it took just minutes to get from the train to my room the area itself is very buzzy with lots of great restaurants and cafes nearby its also walking distance from plenty of the sights of paris i loved exploring montmarte and the sacre coer from the hotel i also walked to notre dame and the eiffel tower from the hotel though this is a longer walk  the hotel is very trendy and has a really contemporary boutique feel with lots of mismatched furniture and kitch artworks throughout my room was large with balconies overflowing with gorgeous geraniums and wonderful parisian views thei know this super cool hofman gang always coll smile and chilled  make no mistak they work very hardthey all wake up an hour earlier i know i wake up 2 hours and see them paris is even an amazing value been in an ihg before no wifi and almost dbl price then doria and her gang cant beat thatthe reception was well organised for check in the room was quite small although classed as a medium the bed was comfortable and warm there was little space to walk passed the bottom of the bed due to a shelf the tv on the wall was enclosed in doors which did not fold completely back to the wall i felt this was a hazard and did i fact bang my shoulder walking passed the bathroom was nice and had a separate toilet due to restrictions regarding covid 19 no room cleaning was available fully understandable they did supply fresh towels on request and did in fact remake our bed twice the only issue i have regards this arrangement was that they did not supply the room with any products for cleaning the toilet  the breakfast was disjointed and a bit disorganised,we were blown away by this excellent hotel we stayed in the hotel for 3 weeks because we did not want to take any risks by staying with our elderly family members full disclosure before you read on we benefited from a long stay rate  we absolutely loved it. The staff is incredibly helpful from giving us a tea kettle for our stay to helping me find my misplaced wedding ring we thought was stuck behind the headboard they went above and beyond what we would have expected from hotel staff. This hotel is also dogfriendly a rare thing to find in paris our dachshund was beloved and we really felt at home during this tumultuous time.

main thoroughfare and near the arc di triomph was clean and quiet the staff was very friendly and the neighborhood was a nice mix of businesses living quarters and restaurantsroom was compact around 10 by 12 and lift up small can only take one person and no wheelchairs but otherwise clean modern and comfortable do not be afraid of booking here just as good as hotels much more expensivewe were 5 persons in a business trip excellent location for us in this trip and good help from the hotel to find good restaurants and to help in general had good food all days not their fault how difficult it is to get taxis at rush hours in paris well situated clean and nice even though the rooms are small like they are so often in paris simple but fine breakfast my only negative comments is that they served cheese in small doses wrapped in plastic at breakfast i would like to see the plastic disappear but all in all i will come back it we have meetings in the same place next yearreception staff was exceedingly cooperative with room changes and dinner bookings air conditioning could be better as airflowcirculation is insufficient please note that lift is very small 3 pax maximumvery near arc

breakfast is usual continential  lovely stay would choose this hotel again if i went backthis hotel located at one of the best location at centerof paris sleep quality was not satisfied us because of the matress  one of the reception guys was good but the rest was not feel you welcome at all we enjoyed our stay at the hotel very clean good service we had no problems during our 5 night stay the location is very near the metro and rer so you can get anywhere very easily good value i recommend for those looking for good location value and reliabilitystayed here for 2 nights and could not fault

Just an advice dont book the room on the ground floor as it is very tiny and you cannot move or have more than a bage.
COQ Hotel Paris,stayed for a short city break  the hotel is a 1015 metro to the central for the eiffel tower and 5 minute taxi to notre dame  we did expect it to be quite far out but were pleasantly surprised how easy it was to get to all the usual sites so if you are looking for something a little quieter away from the centre hustle and bustle this is perfect  this hotel is a bit diy with complimentary tea and coffee and a serve yourself breakfast with fresh pastries ham pancakes and boiled eggs  perfect start to a long days sightseeing  the hotel decor is qwerky cool and classy whilst the rooms are cosey and just right for a short stay  staff were more than happy to accommodate our request of a balcony over looking the city roof tops and flowers as a surprise for my partner  thejust stayed 2 nights in this hotel and i loved its simplicity style location staff room lounge area and breakfast the only thing i was a little disappointed in was the small selection of food on our arrival back from the first day tired and hungry there was a small selection of wholesome snacks as they dont have cooking facilities and the food has to be preorderedwe saw others eating it and it looked delicious  again wholesome and home made i hesitate in recommending it as it is a jewel in a sea of expensive and crapy parisienne hotels strangely the staff were lovely all of them an achievement in paris where redness seems to be norm braviits pretty obvious the vast majority of reviews of this hotel on the internet are written by the management at first it comes off as chic in an odd way but then its clear its more about marketing than the hotel itself there are even weird signs everywhere encouraging guests to post photos on social media with the message be a good part of the community   true the room are cute like many boutique hotels its designed to look like a nice apartment rather than a hotel the bed is also more comfortable than most hotel beds however i was shocked when i arrived because the room was by far the smallest of any hotel room ive ever stayed in you have about one meter on either side of the bed and half that in front of it the door to the toilet doesnt even fully open thiswe absolutely loved our stay at coq hotel all the cute carefully considered little details extremely comfy bed pleasing shower and beautiful big window with a french balcony were just some reasons why we absolutely fell in love with this hotel it made our stay in paris even more memorable3we loved everything about our stay  the hotel is beautifully decorated and very stylish the room amenities are good including lovely toiletries and everything you need for a short stay the service was great  warm and welcoming and it is well located for metro lineswe had a brilliant stay at this hotel on our long weekend to paris it is really well decorated we loved our room massive comfy bed huge shower gorgeous carpet all very much to our tastes we got a really good deal that include a welcome drink which included a few glasses of good wine and super yummy popcorn the location is good near place ditalie so walkable to the left bank breakfast was fabulous really good quality produce the bread and butter was to die for lovely staff too we loved our stay so much we even bought a bottle of their wine as a souvenirwould definitely recommend had a room with a balcony overlooking paris rooftops breakfast is fantastic lots of choice of high quality products decor was modern and trendy and rooms were excellent sizeits hard to find enough superlatives for this hotel right from the check in to the check out we were greeted by friendly and smiling staff the room was small  as expected in paris  but with a reasonably large and nice bathroom everything was in good condition the breakfast was great not the biggest selection but quality items slightly cramped at times  a little wait for a table to be expected nice location in relation to metro lines and the neighborhood seemed peaceful and quiet and then i have to mention that several times we saw the staff go glass  knives and forks etc through to make sure it was perfectly clean  as it was at a michelin starred restaurant would love to stay here again another timewe stayed at the coq hotel for 4 nights in mid may it was as good as the photos and reviews suggest stylish but not pretentious friendly helpful service and a substantial breakfast   we upgraded to the superior room for extra space staying in such a special place we looked forward to coming back to the 13 arrondissement every evening after long days sightseeing in the citythis is without doubt one of the best located hotels we have stayed at in paris location is perfect for walking five minutes from metro with multiple lines converging so no part of paris is out of reach staff are wonderful along with very well maintained and clean premises could not be faultedthis is a lovely hotel the rooms are charming in a minimalist way clean and with plenty of natural light the rooms have windows that can be opened the hotel has an intimate feel yet there is plenty of public space to relax or do work its location close to the place ditalie provides good access to public transport and the staff were helpful in providing information on how to get around the staff are friendly energetic polite wellinformed and speak some english the 24 hour availability of light food options and a machine for tea and coffee is especially welcome the breakfast options are good and the staff accommodated my dietary needs punctually and without fuss  i had an extended stay for work and would certainly stay again this is a gem of a placewe loved this hotel and would highly recommend it for its friendly staff comfortable beds lovely rooms and amazing breakfasts very relaxed and comfortable and well placed in terms of metro station a place ditalie we paid for a larger room which is not so big but this is paris and for the price we paid the size and atmosphere of the room was very fair very large and comfortable bed the bathroom had a bad but no separate shower parking is easy in the neighbourghood and if you like to park in a paid garage prices are 14th the price of more central parisi thoroughly enjoyed my 3night stay at coq hotel in a quieter part of paris conveniently located nearby the place ditalie station with 3 metro lines  the classique room size is standard for paris hotels  it is the thoughtful use of space and design that actually makes staying at this hotel a truly pleasant experience equally the staff were very welcoming and always willing to help delivering quality service  the breakfast at the hotel is lovely and there are also some good food options in the 13eme arr for dinner nearby after a day out  overall an excellent stay i highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting paris and looking to have a standout boutique hotel experiencei was stuck in paris as there was a rail strike and needed a nice place to sit and wait until i was picked up i was looked after immediately upon walking through the door celia was an absolute star the lounge area is to the right of the reception and is cool contemporary and elegant i had the house wine which at 18 euros a bottle was well priced i also had the meat and cheese board for 15 euros which easily fed two adults with loads left over really generous the staff could not have been more friendly they were both fantastic i forget the other guys name but he was amazing too it was so lovely that i returned on the following thursday on the way back to orly and had a few coffees there i adore this hotel and will absolutely be back as soon as im able tothis hotel had everything that you might expect from a 5 star hotel in terms of service helpfulness and atmosphere at the hotel   the place felt like a home away from home with the welcime drink on offer and the boardgames the music was perfect and promoted a wonderfully relaxed ambience i would definitely come againwhat i like the staff overall atmosphere of the hotel and location if metro works bit remarks when there is a metro strike a bit far from centre of paris  room a bit too dark  no refrigerator is the room  bathroom does not have proper extractor in the ceiling price is fine thoughplace ditalie is great spot for good asian restaurants but with the metro only a couple of minutes to the center of paris  the interior is great especially the choice of colours we had the deluxe room with an antique bath very cool i recommend this hotel try the soft boiled bio egg in the morningthe hotel is beautiful and perfectly clean the rooms are gorgeous and the bathroom is a real pleasure  the breakfast is delicious and the staff is really nice helpful and friendly a really great place to stay in paris this is a very nice hotel with modern interior design and attentive staff breakfast was great and the common spaces were comfortable however the room was too small it was difficult cu walk around the bedone of the best hotels ive stayed at the bed was very comfortable and the room was clean and quiet the staff were all friendly a metro station is close by so very easy to get to all the sights we will definitely stay here againwhat i like the staff overall atmosphere of the hotel and location if metro works bit remarks when there is a metro strike a

friendly a metro station is close by so very easy to get to all the sights we will definitely stay here againi am one of the coqs best customers with 20 stays but the coq lost my business   the coq is owned by 2 sugar heirswhose designers had a clever concept   community of quality [coq  rooster]  highlighting quirky decor and chickens that got lost when the hotel became a cash machine for the owners new upscale venture    i am genuinely fond of the staff who try their best  staff turnover has been significant an reallocated and it shows  the mascot pet silky chickens are dead 1 or rehomed 3  the flea market decor remains but the cool clientele is vanishing  the community of quality concept exists largely in merchandising and graphics  during the week photo and film shoots often  leave guests with nowhere to sit at weekend breakfast you can struggle tole coq hotel is located in the 13th district of paris an up and coming neighborhood just steps away from the place ditalie metro station from which you can easily access all the top sites in paris  the hotel lobby has a chic modern decor with velvet sofas cool artworks and interesting coffee table books giving it the air of a stylish cocktail bar theres even a sitting area full of plants and glass skylights which feels like a parisian glass menagerie and sitting room around a cozy fireplace breakfast is a sumptuous spread of fresh baguettes croissants configures fruit yogurt cheeses and meats served in the airy dining room at the front of the lobby the hotel has an elevator which for those of us me included that cant seem to leave home without a giantwe throughly enjoyed our stay at this cozy spot close to the 5  6 train if you are comfortable using the metro we are new yorkers then this is the hotel for you about a 1015 minute train ride to all the major attractions and very easy to transfer to the airport bound trains we loved the design of the hotel very chic very clean and super friendly staff i left my adapter at home and they were kind enough to let me borrow one you saved me from an awful hair day thank you they also do a complimentary glass of wine from 6pm8pm and have a coffee station that you can use anytime of day stay here you wont regret itfantastic hotel uber cool furnishings and vibe  location not as central but certainly worth the extra journey time to enjoy it staff were welcoming and friendly breakfast and drinks were superb enjoyed the experience,stayed for a short city break  the hotel is a 1015 metro to the central for the eiffel tower and 5 minute taxi to notre dame  we did expect it to be quite far out but were pleasantly surprised how easy it was to get to all the usual sites so if you are looking for something a little quieter away from the centre hustle and bustle this is perfect. complimentary tea and coffee and a serve yourself breakfast with fresh pastries ham pancakes and boiled eggs  perfect start to a long days sightseeing.
Campanile Paris 14 - Maine Montparnasse,room was very clean  transportation is very near i am very satisfied for good behaviour of hotel campanile stuffthey are very helpful  all time smiling face when i go paris definitely i booked campanile hotelone more think not in the list i special thanks to axelhotel campanile stuffthis hotel turned out to be perfect for our short stay staff were friendly and helpful the room was small but clean and contained all that we needed walking into the centre of paris was doable but if you are not up for this the metro is nearby the tour montparnasse provides a navigation point for wherever you go and is not far away above all i cannot fault the price which was very reasonable we did not try the breakfasts preferring to use one of the many local cafespros nice hotel very clean rooms has an elevator we got it for a very good price around 80 per night in feb for 2 people so just over 40 per person at the price we got it it was the best deal in paris for us other places that were cheaper were in worse locations  i like the location its not super central but the average time to most destinations is around 1525 minutes which is great it is also quite safe as far as we know and we never got any bad vibes when walking from the metro at night 2 girls alone i would not hesitate to stay in this hotelarea if i was traveling alone in fact the area seems even safer than some central parts aroundnorth of the louvre  we did not have to wait too long for elevator which is great in paris usually buildings have asecond time at this hotel  this time opted for double room for single occupancy to get a bit more room minimal provision but all perfectly acceptable and  keen price breakfast predictable but fineall was well in place clean and tidy  we were informed thatfor security reasons and  after working hours someone would open the front door  they failed to mention that the staff on duty had other duties calling him away from his desk  this resulted in us and other clients to wait outside for 15 whole minutes  lucky for us it was neither cold nor rainingeasy to get to from cdg airport and only a 5 minute walk from denfertrochereau station metro service around paris is also excellent from this location and there are plenty of cafes bars and shops nearby room was small but perfectly adequate for our 3 night stay cleanliness of the room was 1st class and breakfast was very decent too all in all for what we paid my wife and i were pleased would recommend for travellers on a smaller budget who are just want somewhere to sleep for a few nightsthis hotel turned out to be perfect for our short stay staff were friendly and helpful the room was small but clean and contained all that we needed walking into the centre of paris was doable but if you are not up for this the metro is nearby the tour montparnasse provides a navigation point for wherever you go and is not far away above all i cannot fault the price which was very reasonable we did not try the breakfasts preferring to use one of the many local cafesroom was very clean  transportation is very near i am very satisfied for good behaviour of hotel campanile stuffthey are very helpful  all time smiling face when i go paris definitely i booked campanile hotelone more think not in the list i special thanks to axelhotel campanile stuffpros nice hotel very clean rooms has an elevator we got it for a very good price around 80 per night in feb for 2 people so just over 40 per person at the price we got it it was the best deal in paris for us other places that were cheaper were in worse locations  i like the location its not super central but the average time to most destinations is around 1525 minutes which is great it is also quite safe as far as we know and we never got any bad vibes when walking from the metro at night 2 girls alone i would not hesitate to stay in this hotelarea if i was traveling alone in fact the area seems even safer than some central parts aroundnorth of the louvre  we did not have to wait too long for elevator which is great in paris usually buildings have aall was well in place clean and tidy  we were informed thatfor security reasons and  after working hours someone would open the front door  they failed to mention that the staff on duty had other duties calling him away from his desk  this resulted in us and other clients to wait outside for 15 whole minutes  lucky for us it was neither cold nor rainingthis hotel is situated only a 10 min walk from the main montpanesse metro station and is therefore convenient for all attractions the hotel advertises a bar however in reality this appears to be a few drinks behind the reception desk however the staff are pleasant and friendly and speak english the rooms are however small along with the bathrooms which have a toilet shower and i believe some have baths i understand the bathrooms are currently being upgraded the hotel does serve breakfast french style and not what you would expect at an english or us hotel and is expensive at about 10 each due to the small room sizes the beds are small however i am 6ft 2 tall 188cmand and managed without too much effort to stretch out on the bed which my wife and i found verycampanile montparnasse has a really good location near to montparnasse station and metro lines room was small but very clean bed was so comfortable and space enough breakfast was nothing special but tasty good value for moneyhad a good experience staying in this hotel for 3 nights with my boyfriend had no problems here at all checkin and checkout was very easy and the rooms very nice and spacious it was in a good location too with plenty of places to get foodlocated a short walk from montparnasse tgv station the campanile is an ideal place for an overnight stay in paris connections to the rer metro and sncf network make it very easy to travel to and around paris small rooms with compact shower rooms and limited storage mean it doesnt suit a longer stay there is a small breakfast area with tiny outdoor patio serving a good basic buffet breakfastwe stayed in this hotel for 2 nights the room was bigger than expected and fairly modern the people on the front desk were very helpful close enough to a few metro stations 10min walk to get you around to the popular tourist attractions we then checked out and checked back in with our topdeck tour and got a completely different and much smaller room good wifi nice breakfast and a neat and tidy hotelnot really a short walk from gare montparnasse especially in 33degrees but hotel is smart and clean with helpful desk staff room was compact and for the bathroom you needed to be a bit of a contortionist but all the fittings were new and clean shower was good and powerful and towels were effective  breakfast was typically french and seating is a bit of a squeeze but all in all a perfectly acceptable hotel for a few nightsan easy 20 minute walk from the station pulling suitcases very clean comfortable room without the noise from other rooms that other reviewers experienced and we went from here gare montparnasse to versailles chantiers without having to transfer an excellent hotel location for visiting versailleseasy to get to from cdg airport and only a 5 minute walk from denfertrochereau station metro service around paris is also excellent from this location and there are plenty of cafes bars and shops nearby room was small but perfectly adequate for our 3 night stay cleanliness of the room was 1st class and breakfast was very decent too all in all for what we paid my wife and i were pleased would recommend for travellers on a smaller budget who are just want somewhere to sleep for a few nightsgood breakfast is served here although the dining area is quite small so it can be a bit of a challenge dancing with your tray getting through tables staff are really nice however we were constantly asked to show our room keys before heading to the elevator basically annoying for guests but a plus for security so cant complain much accommodation is sort of central depending on your interests in paris the walls are very thin its annoying trying to go to sleep with all the noise that was going on in the next room i was staying on level 5  morning  night they kept the hallway lights off which i thought was strange like what if theres an emergency  i cant see where im going dont think id stay here again but all in all this place is pretty good2 night stay in december 2018 booked as part of a top deck tour its a very good midrange hotel option in paris the room we had was quite spacious with a comfortable bed breakfast was also very good with a number of options including pancakes as well as the standard fare of a continental breakfast no real complaints  it is slightly out of the way from the centre of paris youll need to use line 13 from gat to champslyses  clemenceau and possibly transfer to line 1 get into the city it is easy enough but something worth noting that you will not have views of the eiffel tower etc from this hotelwe stayed here for a new year sight seeing trip we had a triple room which was three single beds two of which were pushed together all had a warm duvet and two pillows a small table in the corner a wardrobe a tv on the wall with local channels although we did find cnn international for news in english we had aircon and a powerful radiator in the bathroom which was a really big wet room fantastic shower however we did have to be a little bit careful not to soak the whole bathroom floor and steam up the mirrors staff all spoke good english and were extremely helpful we booked tickets online the day before for disneyland and reception were brilliant printing them out for us a 10 continental breakfast was available but we chose to get out and see paris the location is great awe stayed here for a total of two nights the staff were very pleasant and extremely helpful the only problem with the hotel is that it is not very central however it is close to a metro station it takes 20 minutes to get to where you want to go by metro the rooms were clean however it was cramped with the suitcases in there was no place to move around if there are 3 people sharing even if it is a child i would not recommend if youre heavy on luggage i would not recommend   the bathroom was tiny the shower cabinet was so small i felt claustrophobic staying in there longer than a minute theres no room to move your hands   there are places to eat around the hotel including bakeries and restaurants if you want to stay in you wont have a problem   for moregood hotel good experience no issues clean room and comfortable to sleep in bed is clean staff are friendly very spacious or was enough for me anyway i stayed with my tour group here enjoyable staywe stayed here 2 nights before heading off on bike trip the neighborhood is lovely and its close to the gaite metro stop the front desk staff were very kind and helpful allowed us to check in early room small but typical euro style bathroom was unusually large which was great and modern  breakfast was typical european continental style no eggs but some other protein choices yogurts cheese meat it served its purpose perfectly did not award 5 stars because my back is aching from the very hard bed  but some may love that also the street noise from outdoors is significant even with windows closed but otherwise a lovely stay in paris in a wonderful hotelgood location close to metro and bus very poor breakfast do not take it room was small but clean modern bathroom stuff helpful at ground floor no view at all bedding and towels changed daily i would recommend it just no breakfastaccommodation is comfortable although rooms are small it is removed from central paris so be prepared to commute in breakfast is nothing to write home about rather getting food while exploring the citystayed here 2 nights as a part of a group tour very crowded as other tours also stayed here  short walk to city centre room was dirty  blood on door and blanket breakfast was available not the greatest but surpassablevery clean rooms bedding changed daily safe box tea  coffee available updated bathroom fresh towels daily and gallons of hot water good value for what we paid bus stop is a short walk and metro also nearby we walked to all the attractions as we love a good walk we did not have the breakfast so we cannot comment on this staff on reception were very helpfulthe hotel it is perfect for those who are in paris to explore as this room has what you need a bed a tv storage space and a bathroom we had a room at the back so although there was not anything spectacular to look at it was actually quite nice as there are pretty little apartments and cobble paths connecting the streets  i cannot make any comment on the breakfast as we did not want to spend 10 euros each day so we bought things from the shop down the road although it did look nice and fresh  travel we flew in to charles de gaulle airport and followed the airport signs to the trains the signs are in english and are very clear so dont panic  metrotrains we went to an information desk red desk in the airport and the gentleman was really helpful he gave us aroom was nice clean and quite spacious for paris ive got no complaints about the room although the walls are very very thin i could clearly hear every moan sound this woman was making in the room next to us haha it was funny but i was abit annoyed when your tryna get some sleep hotel is not central but there is public transport everywhere breakfast was ok id skip breakfast and go out as there are so many great cafes and shops around the area i wouldnt stay here again but it was a good hotel based on the room and hotel facilities, hotel turned out to be perfect for our short stay staff were friendly and helpful the room was small but clean and contained all that we needed walking into the centre of paris was doable but if you are not up for this the metro is nearby the tour montparnasse provides a navigation point for wherever you go and is not far away above all i cannot fault the price which was very reasonable we did not try the breakfasts preferring to use one of the many local cafespros nice hotel very clean rooms has an elevator we got it for a very good price around 80 per night in feb for 2 people.

receptionist sujit and all the others who worked at the reception rue cler was particularly quiet and many restaurants in the area closed the last part of august when we visited but we did like le roussillon next to the hotel and le recruetement two lively parisian bistros and bars when so many restaurants were closed for august vacations hotel rooms small but only compared to american standards just right for paris and a great elevator thank you for a wonderful stay the donovans hope to come back and practice more french with you  it was very nice that sujit offered to hold our

but was not loud i would stay here againhotel was small and quaint has an elevator and dinning place during breakfast clean and quiet if you open your windows you can hear the outside noise of the street market but when closed you dont hear anything having the street market literally outside of your hotel is a blessing you can walk to a bakery souvenir shop restaurants and many many more thingswe spent 2 nights in this small but uptodate hotel recently renovated in a pedestrian area close with a general daily market and many interesting shops it is also close to a couple of metro station line 8 walking distance from tour eiffel and les invalides we will choose this hotel again for our next trip to parisnewly renovated chic little hotel in a perfect location   pedestrian street in the center of the paris   the service and the team there made us feel welcome  love the shower the views the bedding and the ambiancestayed at the cler hotel from dec 28th through jan 1st  i want to thank all the staff especially florentin who helped us secure transportation during the strikes this past december   the view from our room of the eiffel tower was memorable plus   the restaurants the market and shops like the chocolate one on the street made it a great place to stay   its about 10 mins walk from the eiffel tower   rooms are small bathroom was still decent size   the elevator fits two people only or one person with their bagif all you care about is location and cleanliness this place will do the job  but other than that we werent so impressed  we stayed in another hotel in paris near the train station whistler and it was a better hotel not counting the location  you cant beat the location on rue cler with lots of restaurantsshops just meters away and walkability to the eiffel tower  theres a supermarket nearby and the metro stop is not far either    as for the bad tiny room with not much in the way of furniture besides the bed  hard to find a place to put things  tiny claustrophobic elevator and narrow stairs  no freebies they have drinkssnacks available in the kitchen but they are all overpriced  one day they forgot  to restock our room with anything we didnt havethe cler hotel was located on a popular street rue cler with many restaurants and shops the location is great just a 10 minute walk to the eiffel tower we stayed in room 605 and we could see the eiffel tower from our bed and bathroom so cool the room was clean and the bathroom had a rain shower the staff were all very friendly and helpful with answering any questions we had during our stay there is an option to pay for breakfast but we didnt because there are many cute restaurants on the street that serve breakfast would highly recommend this hotel great location friendly staff clean roomswe had a nonrefundable stay scheduled in midmay at the tail end of a 2 week trip  i contacted the hotel to request the amount paid be applied as a credit when we reschedule the trip  the hotel went a step further and refunded the amount for our stay  this trip will be rescheduled and cler hotel will definitely be includedi stayed at the cler hotel for a week in the month of november 2019 for a business trip it isnt a business hotel but then i was ok to be not provided such a business hotel feeling since this hotel was acknowledged greatly for their hospitality which is more important to me as against  i had my wife join me in the middle of the week so that i can use the later part of the trip for leisure visiting in and around paris i went for this hotel predominantly because of  the eiffel tower view and another its proximity to some of the best places around  around the hotel i was overwhelmed when i laid my at the street for the first time  rue cler where this hotel is based it is a bright and colorful street to make your day filled with flowers fruits and eateries  one canmy daughter  i recently stayed here for 3 nights in march 2020 we were absolutely satisfied with this hotel first of all this is a great location if this is the area you want to be in near the eiffel tower it is a lovely boutique hotel with the small elevator  winding steps up to the  reception area we had a room with a view of the eiffel tower which was amazing i could lay in bed and watch the eiffel tower sparkle at night sure the room is not that big but those who complain must not travel in europe often because rooms are not that big the shower was simply wonderful because of the overhead rain showerhead plus we even had a view of the eiffel tower from our bathroom so we loved our room on the 6th floor  secondly the service at the front desk was fabulousperfect hotel with a really nice location near the tower staff is very friendly mearsures about covid19 was perfect everything is really clean a lot of restaurants in de street near the bus and metro with 1 stopover from gare du nord untill the hotel it was like maybe 20 minutes everything was perfect and i really like to come backgreat stay luxurious room excellent location and staff  just a short walk from the eiffel tower with views from the room this is an excellent location for a special occasion or just to visit paris  will be coming backwe stayed at the cler hotel for 3 nights during a long weekend trip to paris the hotel is right on charming rue cler which has plenty of bakeries and restaurants and is less than a 10 minute walk to the eiffel tower rooms are on the smaller side typical for paris but are clean and modern the hotel staff is very friendly warm and helpful with tips for traveling around paris highly recommendedlovely boutique hotel set in cobbled streets full of cafes cheese shops restaurants chocolate shops and bakerys  only a few streets from the effie tower the hotel is super clean and the staff couldnt be any friendlier and helpfuldue to the covid situation they do not make the room or change the towels during your stay this i did not like this information does not appear on the website when booking new hotel with small rooms located on a very lively street all day and night because there is a fruit market noise is heard at dawn when the market is set up the tiny elevator can only accommodate one person close to the metro exit and the eiffel towerone of the best places to stay at when visiting paris this was my third time in paris and without a doubt the best experience hotel wise the staff is nice and helpful the rooms are cosy and overall give you a feeling of being welcome in the city,we had the best stay at cler hotel  the location the staff and the hotel itself is a 1010. We were greeted by the wonderful manager who spoke perfect english and made us feel so welcome. Our room was clean comfortable and quiet with a lovely view out the garden window. Hotel could not be more centrally located to explore rue cler the eiffel.
Esmeralda Hotel,simple but nice and clean hotel great location very friendly personal few steps from notredame and street life of paris few steps from metro and rer train to airports best choice for all touristswe spent three nights at hotel esmeralda august 2019 as we did paris and monet by the book by christina bjrk linnea i mlarens trdgrd perfect location close to buses metro and rer a hotel with character and history with a fantastic staff very friendly and helpful the hotel is not a fancy 5 star hotel but we just loved it because of the location the staff and the feeling we had as readers of the book  a lot of nice restaurants brasseries and cafe just around the corner where we had breakfast and dinner  we loved it and this is the place we will stay at next time in paris  hopefully hopefully it will always exist   family with child of 8 year jonas helena and hedvigthis is the absolute worst hotel in paris i used to live in paris and ive stayed in many different places around the city i used to pass by this hotel everyday on my way home when i studied in this part of town i thought it would be a great location to stay in while the location was nice the actual hotel was atrocious there were several live spiders in the room it reeked of mold and it was as if someone hadnt cleaned the place since the 1700s the staff hung up on me when i called to ask a question about my luggage that they wouldnt let me bring upstairs when i checked in because it was too late at night i had to argue forever to cancel my reservation when i wasnt even there for more than an hour if i could give it 0 stars i would absolute worst experiencestep back in time and experience staying in a beautiful 17th century parisian building  it is quant charming very old world but beautiful  staying in the hotel for our first 2 nights in paris what a treat  a view out of the window to notre dame across the river the famous shakespeare  co bookshop on the corner of the building which houses the hotel all that the latin quarter of paris has to offer  friendly helpful staff comfy bed and nice linenthere was no problems storing our luggage at the beginning and end of our stay no hesitation in highly recommending this lovely hotelstayed for two nights  location central to all sites  hotel is a very basic hotel carpets stained and mould in bathroom  room looked very tired we had a top floor room overlooking notre dame  view was great  room was small and stuffy  very hot even with window open  room was very noisy from the street noise and people talking  but you are in the middle of paris i took my 7 year old daughter to paris for the first time i read really good reviews about this hotel and loved the location i have to say it exceeded my expectations we arrived around 1115am and it was pouring with rain fransisco made us so welcome he said give us 15 minutes and well get the room cleaned for you he chatted to us telling us the history of the hotel my daughter spoke some french weve never felt to welcome at a hotel i knew there wasnt a lift and were in room 12 yes its dated etc but its so french and full of character amazing view of the notre dame and a lovely park location is amazing the train from and to airport is a minutes walk from hotel lots of lovely places to eat and the shakespeare book company around the corner we were given anabsolutely loved staying here at the hotel esmeralda  everything was great location accommodation and most of all the friendliness of the staff francisco was absolutely fantastic with suggestions recommendations and the best croissants and bread in all of paris for breakfast we will most definitely stay here again on our next trip to paristhe good amazing location on top of st michelnotre dame metro and directly across the seine from the great lady friendly service including maid service clean bathroom with a hot shower i slept well the iffy tiny room i know i know its paris rundown carpet and wallpaper stuffy dont go in the summer and a steep climb up the stairs now i like hotels with character and this has it but i was a little disappointed i think to truly enjoy esmeralda you need to stay in a larger room i was in a single on the 4th floor that faces notre dame thats the key this place wasnt dirt cheap either but for the location in the middle of everything it was reasonablethe building dates from 1640 and has an underground tunnel to the seine not accessible we could view notre dame from our window and stroll easily to the metrorer bue line lots of cafes and restaurants nearby including great bakeries for breakfast the staff were great and gave us good information it was fun to see all our fellow tourists come to take selfies in front of the shakespeare bookshop next door and to think we were staying in a part of the same building our room was small and basic door touched the bed when open and the shower was rudimentary no coffee or tea available but we savored the character of this hotel theres even a childrens book that it features inabsolutely loved our 4 nights staying the location was perfect we were on the top floor with a view of notre dame the rooms are quirky but not disappointing there are no coffee making facilities no tv no bar etc in the hotel but that it reflected in the price and it is clean but the location is so good you really want to get out and about the best of all was the wonderful service from francisco he was so helpful and knowledgeable and really wanted us to enjoy paris which we did thank you for a lovely holidayon our trip our aim was to stay in historical places with character and the hotel esmeralda is a winner in both categories you will also not beat this place on location  its as close to point zero as you can get out your window is a park and a view of notre dame downstairs is a famous bookshop and numerous eateries this place is not luxurious there are 400 year old stairs to climb there is no aircon in the room nor even a fridge bad in a heatwave the bathroom is actually good  roomy and clean the staff are excellent friendly helpful and accommodating they are excellent with kids a rating is difficult to give for this place whether you choose to stay here is entirely dependent on whether you want to stay in a part of history or prefer all the mod cons if youfor me hotel esmeralda is the best place to stay in paris notre dame is right across the seine a lot of cafs and restaurants in the area but still not to loud at night i love the interior and the staff is very nice always my first choicethe hotel is very well located unfortunately there is no mini fridge and tv in the room overall we are happy with our stay very friendly staff daily maid service everything is neat and clean at night in early may it was cold so the heater was turned onwe have stayed before a number ion times its an excellent and charming hotel very convenient  for le marais  very comfortable beds and helpful  receptionists   exceptionally clean and  we will  definitely come back and stay for longer i saw 3 bed bugs on the pillow cases when we went to go to bed if you check the sheets theres track marks blood from the bed bugs stained on the sheets i told the staff and they put us in another room the next day im assuming it was the owner was irritated with me that i asked to be put in another room he told me they didnt have any bed bugs on the 1st floor and theyve only had them on the 4th floor  he then told me i likely brought the bugs in despite that and the fact that i didnt see any signs of bugs in the new room they put us in i decided to stay to avoid the stress of trying to find a new hotel in a foreign land wow do i regret that now we had to leave the next morning at 4am to catch our flight and i noticed shortly after leaving that i had 40we have nothing but praise for the staff who helped us greatly working out such things as getting around during the protests you cant beat the location  we chose here based on price and location however room 2 was a nightmare  the double bed was against the wall too hard to get in for someone who isnt a skinny contortionist the wall side of the bed is pushed up by the bed frame so was like sleeping on a ledge with the feeling of falling down the slope onto your partner  the toilet is the tiniest cupboard  my arm kept knocking off the light and my knees were against the door which had to be open to clean oneself  you need to be a very unusually close family we ended up using the toilet off the stairs  closing the shower door was another matter of twisting yourfor such a good location at such an affordable price you cant beat it ok the curtain was hanging off the bed didnt fit properly in the room the fixtures and fittings were tired fir a place to crash it works that said i was travelling solo ideal for a stopover as part of a wider experience elsewhereas said above  for the adventurist like us its good we stayed last 2 nights in room 2 each room unique as you would expect from circa 1640 building we found small quaint clean room with our window looking right at the notre dame and all the excitement of the latin quarter below the receptionist francisco  couldnt have been more attentive and kind showed us the way to many recommended places and attractions just a few yards away is the newly opened madame pops restaurant that in 3 months has a very high rating and good reasonable priced mealsi directly when i came to know about hotel esmeralda felt in my heart i would like to stay there  and when i finally came i felt directly the same i so much appreciate the atmosphere of time that was centuries ago intelligence and warmth  and a lust for life beautiful room with a lovely view towards both the park st julien and seine and notre dame  where i could spend time just looking outside or sleep nice and tight at night  lovely bed i felt safe welcomed and very very warm and kindly treated easy to walk around in the neighbourhoods and to find so many nice parts of paris to visit and see nearby if ever coming to paris again i would always return if possible to hotel esmeralda thank you so much all of

the room we had was brilliantly quirky and just the ticket for our needslocated very close to notredame and is the only point to consider for the rest the rooms are really small not well heated and very low quality of the finishes  the curtain are not blinds curtains so the sunlight will enter in the room in the early morning  the window is just a frame and single glass and not isolating at all  the bed sheets are cleaned but in bad condition and very old the bathroom is very basic as per pictures attached   i tried to change room but it was the other rooms are more or less the same,we spent three nights at hotel esmeralda august 2019 as we did paris and monet by the book by christina bjrk linnea i mlarens trdgrd perfect location close to buses metro and rer a hotel with character and history with a fantastic staff very friendly and helpful. a lot of nice restaurants brasseries and cafe just around the corner where we had breakfast and dinner  we loved it and this is the place we will stay at next time  hopefully hopefully it will always exist.

Fred Hotel,our stay was short but the staff was really attentiveespecially ader  at the front deskmy wife was ill and his kindness genuine concern was reassuringlittle things were done to acommodatei will definitively recommend this hotel to anyone  clean well located with excellent people working theregreat value hotel located in a beautiful part of paris quiet with good local shops and restaurants yet still easy to get to all the sights hotel with modern decor nice rooms and good value breakfast very friendly staffthe staff were very friendly and helpful the hotel was very quiet and a good size so it never felt overcrowded the breakfast was very nice and the breakfast room was clean organised and relaxed also location is perfect not on a busy ride only a couple minute walk to the train station that takes you very close to the middle of paris and lovely restaurants in the area as wellhighly recommended  very comfortable and clean rooms backed by a very professional and friendly staff at the reception very close to the metro and a variety of restaurants in close proximity ideal stay for a business traveler or familythe hotel is welcoming the room are modern with very good sleeping the service always available and people ready to help i really appreciate the location none far from transport with restaurants and shops nearbya clean hotel with friendly staff we stayed for 5 days while we toured around paris its in a pretty good position for this the nearest metro station is a few minutes walk away plaisance  and only 20 mins ride  most of the main sites of interest champs elyssee eiffel tower last louvre etc the staff are all very helpful and friendly all the reception guys speak good english  breakfast is continental style self service it can get a little crowded but all on all not bad in the local area there are several bars restaraunts take aways wine shops and a small supermarket so you can easily cater for any food needs nearby a short cab ride into the centre of the montparnasse area will put you in the way of many good brasserie  next time we are in paris i will check thei had a great experience at the fred hotel staff was very welcoming and friendly the rooms were nicely made up and provided me with everything i needed the location is great  its just off a busy street so that it wasnt very crowded but close enough that i could walk to local cafes for breakfastit was a very nice weekend in fred hotel the service was very friendly and helpful and the hotel esthetical and comfortable the breakfast was also very nice my girlfriend and me were pleased by this inspiring locationordered this hotel for ridiculous overpriced rate and got a tiny room with dirty blanket and broken sink and broken shower head the location is very far from all of the known activities the room was a deluxe room with courtyard views where we had to suffer from party noise until 2am from one of the flats next to it we could not sleep due to the loud music  the only advantage is the nice staff in the hotel  i was very disappointed and this is not my first time in parisimpeccably decorated and super clean its conveniently located one small block from a subway stationthe staff is friendly and efficient if you are going to paris and dont know your way around know this this place is a great choice its the little things though no pun intended the bed when they say its a king size bed its rather on the line of little king size bed the breakfast situation is where it gets a little complicated its not about the quality of what is offered everything is there everything is nice tables are tiny though i find the concept toaster coffee machine and egg boiler kind of difficult to get some instructions would be in order for the life out of me i couldnt make that thing spit out coffee instead of hot water but this would bea lovely hotel a bit off the beaten path still easily accessible by metro small with about four rooms per floors very quiet good service from all the staff things to know the rooms on the last floor have low cellings no showers but this is well described on their website the breakfast was ok this was the main thing that was ok versus excellent  bottom line  now on my short list when i go to parisa small scale hotel surrounded by many cafes and restaurants about 510mins walking distance the main floor lobby is very modernly designed there is an option of buffet breakfast although this wasnt included with my stay the room was kept very clean each day free nespresso coffee was provided in your room as well as a free bottle of water per day staff was very friendly and courteous you are required to pay a small city taxes fee per night we stayed in a superior room and standard room i would recommend a luxury room for more spacewe arrived having booked a room for 3 adults i think there had been some confusion as it took a long time to get a room and when we did it was very small we did get moved to a better sized room for the second  third night the rooms are a bit tatty bed side table coming away glass rolled off and smashed showers dont have a position which doesnt soak the entire bathroom but not your head  but overall hotel was okay and location was perfect lovely shops  restaurants cafes and easy walking to various stations and metro stops as well as into the citystayed for 3 nights as a group of four booked two family rooms which worked well located at the end of the corridor on floor 4 we were able to close a door on the hallway and leave our bedroom doors open in order to make one huge apartment  walking distance to bakeries and restaurants this is a great find metro station near by that can take you to all the parisian landmarks  staff were fantastic and couldnt do enough for us very friendly accomodating and knowledgeable  for parking we parked at the hospital in which the hotel can get you a discounted rate to park  highly recommended and will return in the words of the great arnie himself ill be backvery friendly service personnel and nice rooms   i gotta say fred hotel excellence my experience the service was very friendly and helpful  the breakfast was also fresh  lots of choices and quality items i was pleased by their location which has good connections  i will be happily return on my next visit to parisa collegue and i were in paris for work for several days when we arrived everything was ready and the hostess was really welcoming we were agreably surprised by the practicity of the location  pretty closed from the metro and tramwaysthe rooms were perfect

wonderful professional and friendly staff rooms extremely clean and very uptodate nice breakfast in the morning with coffee breads meats cheeses cereals fruits great hotelwe just returned from paris this week and stayed at the fred hotel  while the accommodations were mediocre at best the service or lack thereof at the front desk from gerard was absolutely appalling  he was completely rude and appeared to be somewhat racist with his disposition and approach with me and my family  the original room that i was assigned upon arriving at the hotel was not the room that i had booked  a superior room  it was the basic room and the black tiles were loose and dirty in the shower   overall the standard room to which i was originally assigned  room number 55 did not appear clean  gerard offered the superior room to me as if presenting an alternative as a concession after i complained however this was the room that i had booked in thevery friendly service personnel and nice rooms   i gotta

good base of you are visiting paris the reception area also has a tv and seating areai only stayed for a couple of nights but i found the hotel very good the room was comfortable and well equipped although as a preference i would chose tea over coffee in the room the staff were friendly and helful if needed a food quality accomodation for a reasonable pricechoosing this hotel was strongly based on reviews as we stayed only a regular weekend in paris which tends to be over quite fast  i liked the style a lot and i would also recommend this hotel to everyone else on a private trip as well for sure during the summer days the hotel is probably very full and not as affordable as during our stay in early may but totally worth a visit it if you have the chancei really didnt want to give fred hotel any reviews esp a negative one as our stay there was mostly okay convenient location etc but the way mr tovo at the front desk handled our checkout was simply appalling he claimed that we hadnt paid for the stay we were charged by the other nice gentleman when we checked in when we pulled up our amex transaction record to show him proof of payment hotel name address date  and amount etc he dismissed us by saying how do i know it was for this trip yup you read it right he basically called us liars then he decided to confirm with the other gentleman who had checked us in by calling him all this time we were standing there like idiots for no fault of our own after his confirmation because ofcourse amex and the wholean small but excellent hotel tucked in one of the sidestreets of the 14th arrondisement we were lucky to have stumbled upon it on the net it is newly renovated clean and wellmaintained the airconditioned rooms were a definite plus during the heat wave that swept paris during our stay the staff was friendly efficient and very helpful i would stay here again if ever i return to this citywe are checking out now from fred hotel it feels like leaving home we were a family of 5 the location is perfect the metro at a walking distance the street full of bakeries and restaurants these rooms are big small but very well equipped clean and the bed is very confortable the breakfast includes high quality products but above all was the service everyone here was more then welcoming  helpful extremely friendly was very good choice staying with u at fred hotel highly recommended,i will definitively recommend this hotel to anyone  clean well located with excellent people working theregreat value hotel located in a beautiful part of paris quiet with good local shops

we asked the reception to change us a room and they did so that guy i dont know his name took me and showed me 23 rooms he was more than willing and polite to help us we moved to a room facing the inner court and it was quite apart from peoples foot steps in the corridor  breakfast was basic free coffee water soft drinks and small cakes offered every afternoon in the lobby was very appreciated we had a terrific week in paristhis hotel is just in the middle of everything if you dont want to use the metro you can walk to all important and attractive places the design is fresh and friendly especially the hall for breakfast everything was cleani have just returned from an excellent stay at the 34b and i would highly recommend to anyone singles couples and families alike   i was in room 303 with a small balcony out onto a small french style side street which i loved as it added to the whole paris experience a lot had mentioned in other reviews ask for a room onto the inner courtyard but i prefer onto the street there are two sets of doors both tripled glazed onto the street so when closed both i heard nothing  the hygience was better than some 5 star hotels i have stayed in and my room was very recently renovated with a perfect bathroom bed and bed linen  of course as usual room size was quite small but that is the deal in paris everywhere my single room had a very good quality firm double bed and enough,hotel 34b was an excellent place to stay during our time in paris it was in a great location the prices were very affordable and the staff was very welcoming and helpful. We liked the decoration of the rooms and common areas many small details in the evening coffee and tea are offered it creates a friendly mabiance. The hotel as a whole is quirky and fungood hotel for both familys and  friends trips.
Hotel Apollon Montparnasse,simply great just spent a week there the place is clean contemporaneous and professionally staffed prices are supergood its more of a 4star hotel disguised as a 3star one location is practical too being next to montparnasse while at the same time being off the main arteriesit is a small hotel with small rooms that the reason i love it its ecofriendly and  the staff are very cooperative and friendly too the subway station is 100 meters away from the hotel and the neighborhood is very silent and parisiani was very disappointed with my stay because i really wanted to love it firstly the rooms are tiny so lucky i was by myself or you couldnt have fit another person in that room secondly the shower was tiny if you drop anything you wont be able to pick it up thirdly pack ear plugs i could hear people snoring in the room next to me at night and the cleaning staff start vacuuming ridiculously early you can also hear a lot of noises at night and during the day the last thing that really irritated me was i came back to the room one afternoon to find they were changing the door handles they had about 3 tradesman in my room they did not notify guests that they were doing repairs during my stay i also had a lot of valuables that could not all fit in the safe i also didntstayed here for three nights the hotel is fine location is great about 510 minutes walk to tour montparnasse and 1 minute walk to the nearest metro station pernety  line 13 reception staff very friendly and spoke english the room is small but clean youre in the centre of paris so a big room would be highly expensive we didnt eat breakfast at the hotel as we went to the city to eat out the hotel is fine if you want what we want just a reasonably priced room that for most of the time you only use for sleeping the next door parking garage service is great if you travel by carreception staff was nice   the room was very tiny and small  the bathroom tiny tiny tiny   this hotel does not provide tissues this was the only hotel that we stayed at that did not provide tissues  very noisy at night  metro was close   the do not disturb sign was not respected  they took the towels and did not replace nor replace the toilet paper seriously  i got my moneys worth with the breakfast quantity  the lady there was very nice though and helpfulclean and nice small hotel well located in a quiet street close to montparnasse station modern clean rooms very nice staff correct breackfast coffee is very good good bathroom with amenities in the sorroundings are some brasseries small restaurants and a suermarketthe room was quite small but this wasnt an issue for us as we didnt need much room there was a nice sized comfy bed as well as a desk and a tv the bathroom was quite small but there was enough room in there for two people there was a clean shower and fresh towels every day  the only downside to our stay was that we had a room on the ground floor which wouldnt have been a problem but the room got very very warm during the day even though it was only october upon arriving back we wanted to open the window but felt like we couldnt as the street outside was fairly busy and we didnt want people looking in  overall this hotel was perfect for a short stay however as this hotel does not have aircon i wouldnt stay during the warmer monthsif your stay in paris is short  and mostly to discover the city  then this hotel cannot be complained about  the scoring points being the location and its closeness to the station from where the metro goes to the various sites in the city  as all reviews emphasize  the room was really really small  difficult to move around but comfortable and clean if the budget matters then adjustment is needed   what i will complain about though is the air conditioning it gets very warm inside the room  specially at night opening the windows did not much help  i was there on the day of the football world cup final  and the noise outside when france won  was deafening but the hotel cannot be blamed for that  at a hands distance are bistros  cafes and pizzerias that serve thei have been in this hotel for new years night it was very warm welcome special thanks to girl on reception the room was nice and warm  a very comfortable bed with 4 pillows for one person  i was sleep like a baby hotel close to metro station and garethe hotel was tidy and overall clean also the receptionists were nice but they didnt speak english well the rooms walls were a bit thin but you cant expect much since its paris thank you for a good stayin short we absolutely fell in love with them  our stay at this adorable hotel was so great and cosy that we will always come back whenever visiting paris so apollon montparnasse is our paris home from now on  the staff is so friendly and helpful that we enjoyed our stay so very much that it is a sheer pleasure to promote the hotel everywhere we can and our very special thanks for the staff who received us tired travelers on our very late arrival and immediately made us feel welcome and happy and happily helped us in anything we cared to ask for and a little more what a fantastic customer experience  nice room excellent modern and spacious bathroom with a beautiful french style window a functional warming system for colder and ac for warmer times fridge ini traveled there with my husband and my sister  the reception guy was not so nice  our room on the third floor was smelly for the 4 days of our stay  we asked them to give our room near my sister but they give my sisters room on the first floor the breakfast was ok but compared to my parents who stayed in another 3 stars hotel it was not so good  it was near metro station which was the only good point  the room was very small for my husband and i because we had 2 luggages and we could not unpack our stuffs at the same time cause of very small roomgood value for money small hotel with amazing service and good breakfast we forgot our shirt in the hotel room the hotel owner  staff working at reception contacted us immediately and shipped the shirt by post to the netherlands very close to the montparnasse tower that offers the best view of the eiffel toweras others have mentioned the rooms are quite crammed however reasonably priced against the market in paris therefore a reasonable deal overall for its price there are plenty of facilities close by and it is situated within a 10 minute walk from a lively area of the city a pretty good base for a short stay in parisapollon montparnasse hotel is a very good hotel its very clean and neat all staffs are very helpful and friendly location is very good close to 3 metro station and the we were all satisfied with staying here however you should know that rooms are very tiny it was the most tiny room ive ever used in my whole life but in an expensive city like paris you cant expect more in such pricei have visited twice now and would again   situated in what feels like a very real area of paris with excellent cafes bars and boulangeries just around the corner we even managed to park our car with trailer on the street for the duration of our stay   thanks to the staff who accommodated our bikes in their courtyard the first time there were thirty of us the second time just four   theres a metro at the end of the street 150 metres away and you can walk to eiffel tower which is around two miles and paris is pretty flat   beds are comfy prices are reasonable en suites are decent and our rooms came with traditional tall french windows which adds a huge amount to the experiencei really enjoyed my stay was torn between honouring my itinerary and staying in my room all day the water pressure in the shower is great very clean and cosy also worth saying that i often have misfortune of staying in hotels with really smelly drains but this was not the case at this hotel indeed it is small and might feel tight for other users but cleanliness is more important to menot sure if we were just stuck in the bad room that every hotel has at least one of or whether they are all like this but with two people in the room we literally had to coordinate our movements in order for two of us to get around the bed from one side to the other   nice enough rooms although the walls were pretty banged up but not a surprise with such tight spaces the decor was average and furnishings basic quality although there was a small bar fridge with a few items in the room significantly missing was any coffee or tea and a 150euro charge for the coffeetea in the lobby  the staff were very friendly the neighbourhood is actually quite nice during the day but a little rough at nightin paris for business for 3 days and the room was great for my needs small but good size for one person and a desk to work on clean and comfortable with nice little window out onto the street loved the location nice atmosphere and very quick to get the metro and walk to lots of nice resturants etc staff were very professional and polite only issue was that the walls are quite thin so the noise was a bit intrusivea nice cosy hotel in a quiet neighbourhood neat room and bathroom excellent breakfast but be early as the room is small and gets filled up very fast unfortunately bed sheets were wet and on a cold night it wasnt pleasant at allsimply great just spent a week there the place is clean contemporaneous and professionally staffed prices are supergood its more of a 4star hotel disguised as a 3star one location is practical too being next to

allwalking distance from the metro it was a very nice hotel the staff was friendly the room comfortable clean and nicely decorated i just found the bathroom a bit small maybe a shower instead of a bathtube might have been more convenient1 good location  just 12minutes on foot from fernety stationmetro line 14 2 good staffs  in the beginning their service was not so good and i was very upset however their service was becoming improved day by day and i got very satisfied with it on my checkout day  3 cleanliness  room is very small but very clean there are separate spaces for toilet and shower room with sink each door was very useful to block the bedroom from them 4 no soundproof wall  this is the only thing that the hotel should improve if possiblehotel is in a generally quiet neighborhood with many good restaurants bistros and brasseries a short walk away  hotel is a short walk from gare du montparnasse where we caught the lebus direct shuttles to cdg and orly  very convenient hub for rail metro or bus connections all around paris and versailles  hotel rooms are on the small side but adequate for our stay  rooms were clean comfortable and quiet  a great choice and bargain for visiting paris without the tourist masses encroachingthis place seems new but the rooms are really small if you have 2 luggage you can barely walk around  it is a place that is great if you want to budget a bit the train station is literally a few minute walk not very far at all  same as what the other reviews say its convenient to get where you are going  initially when we got there it looked a bit suspicious with people standing outside  but next day it was fine there are a few barsrestaurants down the way so it made us feel better they have this great pastry place down the street from there it is soo good must try this place is definitely worth it for the priceour party booked three rooms for a short stay as we transited paris on our way to bordeaux the rooms even though small  were accommodating and adequate for our stay nothing fancy but i must admit that the beds were extremely comfortable for a good nights rest the hotel is in a nice quiet neighborhood we enjoyed walking to the many nearby restaurants even at night and felt safe we had a hearty continental breakfast the first morning at an added cost but chose to walk to a nearby bakery for coffee and pastries the next day the pernety metro stop is convenient only a block away from the hotel and we took line 13 directly into the champs elyses there was a mix up with the room assignments we travelled with a 10 month infant and had requested a baby cot which was not,simply great just spent a week there the place is clean contemporaneous and professionally staffed prices are supergood its more of a 4star hotel disguised as a 3star one location is practical too being next to montparnasse while at the same time being off the main arteriesit is a small hotel with small rooms that the reason i love it its ecofriendly and  the staff are very cooperative and friendly too.

really nice and helpful sanjay was always ready to help with any kind of demand from a restaurant  to a pcr test reservation i recommend itmy family of four stayed in two separate rooms on the ground floor at hotel artus for one week while we visited paris  the rooms were large by paris standards  everything was very clean and tidy  we appreciated the multiple outlets in the rooms including an outlet inside of the rooms safe where we could charge our devices  there was free fast wifi  i was impressed at how quiet the rooms were especially for being on the ground floor  sleep quality was high  each rooms bathroom had modern upscale plumbing fixtures with marble showers and floors  breakfast was available in the hotel  the accommodations worked very well for us    the location of the hotel cannot be beat  rue de buci is a fun vibrant area with a vast number of restaurants nearby  mabillon metrowe recently spent three nights here and enjoyed it very much the hotel is close to shopping restaurants and the metro and the rooms are comfortable and wellappointed sanjay the concierge could not have been friendlier or more helpful in making restaurant reservations or calling our

for activities around the city the rooms are clean cozy and modern there is nothing to complain about the location is fantastic directly on rue de buci one of the most beautiful streets in paris there are so many brasseries restaurants and bars we will definitely come backwhen prepping for my wifes birthday trip to paris our first time in europe let alone franceparis i did alot of prep work many excel sheets were created and refined over about two months i did a deep dive into the 20 parisian districts looking for the one that was closest and within walking distance of the attractions we were most interested in close to the seine the louvre luxembourg gardens and highly rated restaurants eventually i settled on the 6th arrondismentdistrict st germain and then zeroed in on the hotel artus which beat out about 10 other hotels  and im soooooo glad i did   the hotel is located in a very lively neighborhood where theres no shortage of cafes and patiserries i read about the noise factor being an issue for some on the first andwe stayed in a nice comfortable and clean room the location is perfect and the staff was really really nice and helpful sanjay was always ready to help with any

did   the hotel is located in a very lively neighborhood where theres no shortage of cafes and patiserries i read about the noise factor being an issue for some on the first andlovely hotel and exceptional service especially from sanjay kaloya best concierge ever from the moment our taxi stopped he greeted me by name and took care of helping us plan out 3 days in paris including making dinner reservations at 3 of the most charming restaurants   our room was very nice and modern breakfast was bountiful and wonderful  worth the price the location is in the heart of saint germain and perfect for walking to most places tons of restaurants  my only complaint was our room was over a busy street and there was noise late into the night from people out enjoying the nightlife other than that i would highly recommend this hotelwe really enjoyed our stay at hotel artus and paris overall  the hotel is in a great location reasonably priced central to many things we wanted to do with corresponding metro lines and on a street with great cafes restaurants a small grocery store and wonderful bakery for the best bread  we had decided to stay on this side of the seine and we are glad we did  so many things to do in paris  we need to come back  finally and most importantly our concierge sanjay was very helpful knowledgeable and always very friendly  it was a treat to see him each dayat the outset asking for an early checkin is a waste of time after a long transatlantic flight i got to the hotel at 1300 but the receptionist refused to grant me access to the room as checkin time is 1500 they later gave me the room at around 1420   the location of the hotel is great and the room design is nice but thats all there is to it the service is very slow and they seem to be understaffed despite leaving the clean the room sign at the door i left the room one day for four hours in the morning and came back to find my room just as i left it i had to call the concierge to request the cleaning lady and it took her 15 minutes to come over and clean the room  lastly despite the not so cheap cost of the room water pressure in the shower was horrendous i amwe had a great time at artus hotel its extremely well located very central and close to plenty of restaurants and bars also has a taxi stand very close by the staff were the best they went over and above would highly recommend a stay thereperfect location close to lots of cafes bars and restaurants and walking distance to many tourist attractions good breakfast kept us going all day welcoming staff especially sanjay the longtime concierge of the hotel comfortable room enjoyed our stay very much and intend to returnafter 2 yes of not being able to visit we were ecstatic to go back to our

the elevator is super small it was hard for us to get our luggage to our roomswe are a family of four with two children we stayed at the artus in the first half of march 2020 in the exclusive suite on the 6th floor of the hotel this is a boutique hotel and we always felt like vips while we were staying there  the suite can work as a large couples area or as two connected rooms for a family setup both rooms have a private sink and toilet the master bedroom also has a jacuzzi and a very luxurious shower the tub and shower are open to the bedroom there is a nice balcony which runs the length of the room and has lights it took me three days to find them  look behind the curtain on the closet side the layout of the suite makes this a largerfeeling more flexible and more private space than you

keep coming back again and again when in paristhis is an exceptional hotel from the moment we stepped into reception until the moment we left we could not have been happier   greeted by sanjay who straight away offered great advice on the local area including places to visit and eat   the hotel itself is ideally located close to many wonderful bars restaurants and shops all the major attractions of paris are within walking distance or there is a metro station nearby  the room was very comfortable and tastefully decorated and all hotel staff made us feel very welcome  highly

again when we visiting pariswhen we got to hotel we were welcomed by a very friendly chap on reception who checked us in and told us how to get up to our room the hotel struck us as clean but old and in need of revamp on entering our room we were suprised at how small it was and if i am honest we were dissapointed but its saving grace was the bathroom which was modern with a  large walk in showerthe room also had tea making facilities and a free no alcohol mini bar which was great we got used to the room and the beds were very comfortable breakfast was ok but predictable in summary this hotel was great value for the price we paid and we did avail of their free afternoon refreshments and snacks which were also available in all of their hotels in paris of which we we visited 23the

probably stay here if we visit paris again extensive breakfast  very clean room  friendly staff  situated in a calm street  the lovely neighbourhood can be easily explored by foot  access to public transport in close proximity  sacre curmontmarte  arc de triomphe can be reached within less than half an hour   unfortunately the walls arent soundproofed therefore 4 rating points  but still would definitely come here a second time staff is friendly room is clean and has balcony access location is great with multiple mtro and bus connections nearby breakfast buffet is quite good and has daytoday variety the bathroom is wellequipped and nice however the shower is terrible with really bad water pressure and wildly varying temperature  so much so that it can go from lukewarm to burning hot within a split secondth hotel is nice convenient to metro stop rome but that is somewhat limiting  the breakfast at 8 euros is a great deal  staff is friendly speaking many french english and several others my room had a bathtub which most more modern hotels do not some snacks in the breakfast area in the evening  free soft drinks in the minibarnice clean and tidy hotel the location is good metro station is near  staffs were really helpful  the breakfast is really good and the service is exceptional special mention to tej and his team  cheers would like to visit again    thank you so much guys the hotel staff greeted us politely and were accommodating of our request for a late checkout rooms are fairly basic but good value for money by paris standards housekeeping was top notch and fresh juice and water was replenished every day  tej at the breakfast buffet was very affable and friendly and helped us have a pleasant experience  overall would recommend the hotel for budget travelers the only area of improvement was the breakfast which was below averagethe hotel was nice and the viennoiseries for breakfast were tasty we enjoyed our weekend stay in paris the hotel staff was extremely available and kind the hotel is located close to all interesting areas of paris  fozz waju,quaint little boutique hotel in an off the tourist path part of paris. Room was small but comfortable  the bed was a bit hard for my taste but i slept like a baby anyway. Staff was ecceptionally kind and professional especially tj and everyone could speak english fluently rooms were cleaned well every day and the temperature was perfect even at night.
Hotel Augustin - Astotel,a great hotel for a stay in paris we spent two nights here and cant complain the hotel is situated about a 35 minute walk away from saintaugustinmetrostation theres lots of

obviously louder   the bathroom in our room seemed to have been recently renovated everything was modern great water pressure warm water throughout everything was very clean spacious enough rooms for

paris i highly recommend this hotel for families and coupleswe stayed here for the second time in two years and if anything it was better than the first i can only echo the previous reviews re

enoughfantastic hotel right near the arc  lovely rooms and great staff who were ever so helpful   the rooms are lovely and modern and a wonderful location  breakfast at the hotel was lovely and plenty of choice along with great coffee and tea  nothing was a problemweve just returned from a 9 day visit to paris inspired by the christo wrapping of the arc de triomphe  initially i chose hotel balmoral due to its proximity to the arc but it turned out to be so much more  this is a delightful smallish hotel family owned and fairly recently renovated  the beds were comfortable the bathrooms new and nicely stocked and the breakfast spread was substantial  all good but the best was the staff  they were helpful even before we arrived  my email queries were responded to promptly  their list of restaurant was recommendations extensive and the front desk  helped with museum reservations and airport transport  a metro entrance was around the corner and couldnt be more convenientwe stayed at the hotel balmoral for two nights recently and found it to be a wonderful hotel in an incredible location the staff couldnt have been nicer offering us coffee and croissants when we arrived at 9 am after a long flight our room was lovely and the breakfasts were delicious it is elegant welcoming and delightful the concierge recommended le hide restaurant which is almost next door and it was perfect i absolutely would stay there again we stayed at a different hotel in our return to paris after a week in provence and we agreed that we should have gone back to the balmoralnice room with very good bathroom excellent breakfast located in a quiet little street only two minutes by feet from the arc de triomphe friendly and helpful people at the reception we got bicycles to use free of charge we had all we needed for a very pleasant stay  thank youexcellently located close to arc de triomphe well organized extremely friendly and helpful people running the hotel comfortable and cozy room with a very good bed this was a very good recommendation by friends of oursthe hotel balmoral is a very quiet and comfortable place in a vivid surrounding only a few hundred meters from the arc de triomphe it offers comfortable rooms and a good breakfast there are excellent restaurants in the neighbourhoodgood location for arc de triumphe and champselysee etc quiet location rooms are small but in good shape bathroom was well done very friendly reception staff at breakfast very busy  a second waiter could certainly help to manage the processthank you tripadvisor readers we relied upon your feedback and we were not disappointed traveling during this era of covid is challenging the front office staff did everything they could to make all the pieces of the puzzle fit together into a fabulous visit and our room was above expectationswe recently stayed at the hotel balmoral for a weekend the location was perfect being so close to the arc de triomphe and whilst the metro station is very close to the hotel it is also well placed to sightsee by foot the front staff were very courteous and friendly and particular thanks go to anneclaire for being so helpfulthe buffet breakfast offered a varied and fresh selection of food again with friendly waiting staffwe had booked a superior double room which was very clean spacious and had a nice atmosphere we would certainly use this hotel again and it is highly recommendedwe booked a weekend break at the balmoral and were very happy with our room the service of the staff was excellent and we felt very well taken care of throughout our stay i can recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a romantic break right in the city of paris with easy access to all the sights and activities via the nearby metro station taxi bus or walking thank you to claire for looking after our needs every step of the wayi made a reservation for my daughter to stay at hotel balmoral for four nights she had nothing to say but excellent feedback on her accomodation experience  the location was perfect being so close to the arc de triomphe  and she was able to do her sightseeing  mostly by foot   the front staff was very courteous and friendly  the  buffet breakfast offered a varied selection of food to start her day  the prestige double room that she stayed was clean spacious and had a charming atmosphere an additional amenity offered  by the hotel for use of their bicycles for free was very much appreciated we plan to visit paris in december and will definitely  consider staying herethis is a great small hotel located in the 17th ar  the rooms are very comfortable and the buffet breakfast is extremely good  nice variety  the mangers are very helpful and friendly  highly recommendwe really enjoyed our stay at the hotel balmoral the staff was welcoming and friendly the rooms were comfortable and wellequipped the location was excellent near the arc de triomphe a metro station with three different lines and several bus stops there was also a small grocery shop across the street which came in handy for snacks the breakfast was delicious and the free bike rental was much appreciated my best hotel stay in paris to date would definitely returnsituated just behind letoile arc de triomphe this small fourstar hotel pleases and surprises in equal measure rooms are handsomely decorated lighting is excellent and the doubleglazed windows keep out extraneous noises though there really arent any on this quiet side street just off des champs elyses if you are a fivestar hotel client but have found things at that level beginning to get maybe a little expensive consider a step sideways i know you may consider it a step down but it really isnt and take a look at this comfortable personable little hotel you like me may be pleasantly surprised anyway hotel balmoral is now on my top ten listwe stayed here in late july  we picked it because it was highly rated on tripadvisor and reasonably priced  perfect on all counts  the staff was terrific had a taxi ready for us at 5am to the airport  great location rooms were lovely  spacious bathrooms  minibar was stocked and reasonably priced  would definitely stay here againi recommend your hotel due to the kindness of your staff and quality of the hotel good beds no noise in or outside clean and new bathroom service outstanding we could park our bikes in the hotelthe art work and rooms are amazingly beautiful and the staff were so helpful and friendly even with questions before we arrived  loved the comfortable beds and the hotel served one of the most delicious buffet breakfasts ive ever had   i think my motherinlaw wanted to take the jams with heri call this hotel my parisian home as it feels like it i always go back to it as i am welcomed back like a family member service is very professional room and amenities excellent breakfast plentiful everyone is very discreetly covid aware without it being overdone but it is efficient location as other reviews have mentioned is excellent and even in the street there is an al night small supermarket and you dont have to go all the way to the champs elyses to find a good restaurants some are around the corner  if you come by car public parking is close by and you can get a discount through the hotel  thanks to christian and all his staff for their welcome professionalism and friendliness does christian ever stop he is always there when you need him and more than happywe stayed 4nights in a suite with 2 bedrooms staff were attentive friendly and much better than at many chain hotels they got us all of our taxis gave good advice for dining rooms were very clean and comfortable walking distance to shoppingan excellent hotel centrally placed  very easy to find and

accommodate our large pieces of luggage and gave us room to spread out a bit  the glass doors to the street side kept the noise out at night and gave us a beautiful view of the street and other buildings while open the hotel was a short walk from the metro station where we could travel throughout paris without walking long distances  there were many restaurants convenience stores and bakeries nearby our favorite part was the staff and the charm of the hotel  really liked the antique elevator  what wewe felt at home in this lovely hotel which is situated only a few minutes to go

good,we used the bradford lyse as our home base for our two week visit to france the staff was amazing from excellent customer service to recommendations for restaurants and welcome local information in particular nirosha laurent and alphonsy made our stay particularly pleasant. The hotel itself is located within walking distance to a lot of the monuments attractions and restaurants the hard working staff were very much appreciated.
Hotel Brittany,very nice hotel good price for its location a lot of attractions close by such as sacre coeur opera galleries lafayette etc we have walked once to the eiffel tower but its a good hour walking otherwise we used uber all the time works well the hotel is very cosy rooms are small but i would say its ideal for the ones who are visiting the city breakfast was good but there is also other places aroundloved this place cozy romantic and near to everything there is a metro station just around the corner as well lots of cafes and lots to do just around the corner the staff is very friendly and always willing to help you i recommend this place highlygreat location very good breakfast but when you ask for the internet they say that the only one is orange which obviously is insecure slow and basically does not work it is unacceptable that they don t give you a proper connection when there is a brittany one i won t return i have never lived something like thisvery clean hotel that is well located good sized bathroom and nicely decorated lobby bar wasnt open at any time and a paris pass was delivered that reception denied any knowledge it was only when paris pass phoned reception they could be bothered finding it reception seemed pushy in getting us to take a taxi they recommend to the airport rather than we had booked and paid forstayed for 3 nights last week check in was easy and staff very pleasant throughout our room was a fairly small but typical of paris hotels a comfy bed and well decorated a clean bathroom and good warm working shower the location is excellent not far from gare du nord main train station the neighborhood is brilliant lots of coffee shops and eateries within walking distance montmartrepigalle area approx 15 mins and sacre cour cathedrale 2025 mins awayhubs and i stayed here for 4 nights in a non smoking room on 1st floor at far end from main stairs pleasant stay clean and comfortable room ac works well bathroom is good size clean and working in good condition staff are cheerful and friendly we will definitely stay here again for next triproom was a little more spacious than the typically smaller hotel rooms on paris and has air conditioning although at the time of our visit not working at its best front desk was able to give us a fan and that made a big difference   comfy bed wonderful soaker tub and windows that spill out into the courtyard  quiet   literally walk out the door and you are have cafes and shops waiting for you  only a few minutes walk to galeries lafayette and its breathtaking stain glassed ceiling   friendly staff great location and comfortable roomsthe location is very parisien  the neighborhood offering a wide range of specialities gourmet cafeteria restaurants for one person the public transportation is ok i came by roissybus from ch de gaule airport 12 euros one stop at opra  the first night room was clean and nice view on the street but very noisy and cold because the windows are not closing properly if this issue will be settled the room is ok the air conditioning is not working in cold season so the only heating source was the bathroom heater keeping the bathroom door open the second night i change the room with a bigger and soundproofed one but dark and sad  the backyard with walls here no heating at all on my request they provide a mobile air flow device i cant used it during the nightthe staff are warm and welcoming and eager to help the rooms are on the small side but adequate for a short stay we had a room with a magnificent view of the sacre couer all lit up at night there are bars and restaurants nearby that offer a variety of different cuisines and range from the inexpensive to mid top endwe stayed here for 3 nights and it was adequate but id spend a few  more and find something better  upon arrival we checked in and the guy on reception wasnt that friendly he barely lifted his head to talk to us he gave up our room number and key and that was it we werent given any directions to our room and after a minute had to ask where was the lift and what floor were we on before he could be bothered to tell us  omg the lift is tiny 2 adults and 2 small suitcases at a max so we just used the stairs after that the room was ok but the shower was broken and you had to stand in it holding the shower  above your head which apparently is ok when we complained to the woman at reception next day and every morning we complained about the shower been broken but thestayed here for three night over new year  booked a standard double which was bard on the 4th floor the room are on the small side but clean bathroom is adequate there are tea and coffee facilities in the room but we had to leave reminders so room service would leave replacements the hotel is in a superb location for the notredame lorette metro and all the main shopping areas fare du nord is a 15 minute walk and if youre fit enough 20 minutes from the sacrecoure lots of bars and fabulous bistros nearbypro  nice rooms  location 2 metro lines and buses in close vicinity many restaurantsbars couple of minutes to montmartre 30 min by foot to the louvre  concierge at checkin was lovely  5th floor rooms have minibalconys more like french windows  normal hand shower  overhead shower  modern rooms trendy bar on the bottom floor  con  power outlets and light switches are illuminated whatever for and that makes the room much to bright to sleep comfortably  bed tiny for 2 people  pillows lumpy  uncomfortable  thin walls could hear people in neighbouring room enjoying themselves  concierge couldnt tell us where to get stamps  breakfast was a bit poor for the price  staff overseeing the breakfast buffet was kinda creepy and weird  room was not reallyi only stayed here for one quick night before leaving paris i found my room neat enough though on the first floor i was subjected to the street noises that naturally occur in a large city the room was clean if a bit frayed at the edges the staff was very friendly and spoke good englishmy wife and i decided to travel europe to celebrate our birthdays  first stop paris we  picked hotel brittany due to its location specifically to moulin rouge but also its proximity to many attractions and a reasonable price  upon arrival we were slightly disappointed tired after a ten hour flight we needed a quick nap and shower  the room was very small and had some watermarking discoloration on the ceiling and no view despite asking for a decent room upon check in  i let the manager know that i had some issues with the room and that it was not exactly what we had in mind for our four days in paris  we were given a reasonable upgrade that really made the difference in our stay  the staff were helpful and the hotel was really quite charming the location was perfect forthis was my second stay at this hotel and again it didnt disappoint friendly helpful staff nice and clean very central to a lot of attractions all within walking distance a metro station just around the corner for those longer trips  i will definitely be back againme and my friend stayed here for a short break for 4 nights the hotel itself was beautifully kept very nice and helpful staff who always had a smile on their faces  the only downside to the hotel itself is that there isnt anywhere to get a coffee apart from at breakfast and when we asked for milk they said they only had cream  as we were leaving our bathroom seemed to have acquired a number of ants not to sure where they were coming from i wouldve mentioned it but we had to check out  the eiffel tower notre damn champslyses and the main marathon is approximately 30 mins to 1 hour away by walking depending on if you stop to take in the sights   all in all a lovely little boutique guest house with lots of character friendly staff and quirky bits i wouldit was a pure pleasure to spent a weeekend in this charming hotel located in lovely neighbourhood close to bars cafes and restaurants walking distance to city centre and main attractions you wont be disappointed with superb customer service and lovely fresh tasty brrakfast i am sure you will fall in love with main restaurant and bar area where you can grab a glass of wine or cocktail on afternoon thank you for lovely stay and i look forward to back here again very sooni choose the brittany hotel because i remembered it from my first time in paris 30 years ago  that is true  naturally things change but when i looked it up and saw that it was still in existence read the reviews and saw the rate i booked it  i am very happy that i did  the hotel is a 5 minute walk from the notre dame de lorette metro stop in a nontouristy area of paris  if you want to exit your hotel and be among all the tourists and the most popular sights this might not be for you  but if youre like me and you want to walk the streets and feel as though you are in a real parisian neighborhood i would highly recommend it  it is a very short walk to the opera and the stores on blvd haussmann and a slightly longer but still reasonable walk up to montmartre  theno complaints the entire staff was very friendly and they were all bi or multi lingual i stayed in a cozy room so it was small but i wasnt in it very much the lift is tiny capacity three people but its not the end of the world if you have to let one person go up and wait for it to come back down  wifi worked fine was a little slow once or twice but nothing significant  bus and metro options are very nearby and its within walking distance of montmartre and three of the major train stations paris has a fantastic public transportation app so its really easy to catch a bus or the metro to the city center like around the eiffel tower theres a bakery right around the corner and lots of restaurants nearby as well  their early booking discount was phenomenal when ibooked 7 weeks prior for a 4 night stay was told on check in would have to move after 2 nights due to planned work surely should have planned the bookings better but as there was noisy work going on in the room above thought it would be better to move until we realised we were immediately below our original room so had noise again   the hotel is in a great area and we would stay in this area again the final straw was out airport taxi which we booked on day 2 reminded reception on day 3 and the final night only to be told half an hour before we were due to leave they nothing had been booked the very unhelpful man on reception just told us to try uber ourselves as everyone was on strike after checking the metro was running which it was but 5 changes with 4 casesthis hotel is very central in paris easy walking distance to the sacred heart cathedral positives the rooms are large for what you would expect in central paris and very clean the staff are friendly and helpful  neutral the elevator may be the smallest i have ever seen which i actually enjoyed but others with claustrophobic tendencies may find distressing  negative mild my rooms toilet leaked slowly which meant there was a trickling sound all night the room was slightly too dark as the windows faced into a courtyard  on balance strongly recommendedvery clean hotel that is well located good sized bathroom and nicely decorated lobby bar wasnt open at any time and a paris pass was delivered that reception denied any knowledge it was only when paris pass phoned reception they could be bothered finding it reception seemed pushy in getting us to take a taxi they recommend to the airport rather than we had booked and paid forstayed for 3 nights last week check in was easy and staff very pleasant throughout our room was a fairly small but typical of paris hotels a comfy bed and well decorated a clean bathroom and good warm working shower the location is excellent not far from gare du nord main train station the neighborhood is brilliant lots of coffee shops and eateries

insecure slow and basically does not work it is unacceptable that they don t give you a proper connection when there is a brittany one i won t return i have never lived something like thispicked it cos its close to my meeting very accessible theres literally a tram stop round the corner an english pub round the other corner and a carrefour round the other corner  dont forget your toothbrush

room from november 26 2019  december 2 2019  the room while a little tight was fine for the three of us  the hotel and our room was spotlessly clean and the staff most of whom speak english were

everything was very clean 2 pillows to choose from one memory foam one other one  i specially liked the soap dispenser at thewe stayed 5 nights during our trip to paris good and practical hotel clean

with many eateries at bercy village plus right next to a supermarket quiet neighbourhood whenever we leave and return to our hotel which is something that we like we had very happy stay at this hotel since everything works for us  great location acceptable service and clean room highly recommended for both business and leisure travellerswe stayed here for one week as part of a family vacation  accessibility  everything about this hotel is tiny  from the small to nonexistent lobby to the small elevators breakfast room and especially the rooms   it would be difficult if not impossible for anyone in a larger electric wheelchair or with a wide walker to maneuver in the elevator or breakfast room   to be fair we did not stay in an accessible room  however the rooms we saw when the maid was cleaning and the one we stayed in was so small that it was difficult to pull a suitcase between the end of the bed and the wall  it was impossible for two people to walk past each other anywhere in the room  and the bathroom was approximately 5 ft by 6 ft  the walk in shower is very small about 3 ft by 3 ftok location about 15  30 minutes from city center  room is quite small for a couple and baggage but was satisfactory breakfast was ok and windows are good for a quiet sleep was clean  take a tray with your breakfast as itll be suggested by one of the attendants front counter staff was good and spoke englishthe hotel is close to the metro station cour saintemilion line 14 in a nice area with plenty of shops and restaurants in bercy village within 15 minutes you can reach the city center  chatelet les halles still using metro line 14 the hotel staff was very friendly the rooms are clean maybe a little uninspired breakfast is very nice the pains au chocolat are top of class  overall a nice stay in a not so overcrowded area of parisstayed here for a few days and it is a great location to get around paris the metro is a few hundred metres from the front door the staff at the hotel are knowledgeable friendly and very accommodating highly recommend this hotelwe stayed at the kyriad hotel paris bercy village from september 25  29 2019 this is a mid range hotel that was reasonably priced with a subway close by the rooms were adequately cleaned staff were friendly and helpful there is a grocery store close by and plenty of restaurants this was a great base for us to use the subway to get to all the points you dont want to miss while in pariswe stayed here for one night on our way to italy and that was enough the room was clean and quite comfortable but very small like a poor relation of premier inn  its in an area without much to offer in terms of anything to do in the evening and the hotel doesnt really offer much either  depends what youre after and it is perfectly adequate just not somewhere you want to do anything other than sleepnothing i can fault really location is great close to the metro lots of restaurants and shops 10 minutes walking from the accor hotels arena room was quite small but ok didnt need more for the 2 nights we stayed there bed and pillows were very comfyit could be a matter of preference but the pilows with memory foam and matress are just like what we have at home hadnt it been for the alarm wed never wake up one of the most clean places weve ever stayed beyond impressed maybe its not the newest stuff but the bed and the clenliness did everything for us 24 hours reception also good as we checked in after 23 it was perfect for us i would definetly return the area hasnt been fully explored yet great place to stay for any couple thats looking for quality for thewe stayed at kyriad paris bercy village for three nights on our vacation to paris  advantages   located very near to metro station and bus stop is also just outside of hotel so it is very easy to get around city using public transportation many reataurantsbars available just outside metro station and hence easy availability of food near by   staff is helpful and available to answer your queries   teacoffee maker in the room   bed and mattress were comfortable to sleep  improvements   room size was very small even when we were given the biggest room in the entire hotel as per hotel staff hardly any space in room to stand or even keep your luggage comfortably   no or very poor bathroom toiletries bathroomtoilet seemed very old style and had a feel of old house typekyriad hotel is a good hotel placed in a fabulous area bercy village the hotel is standard in every way not pretentious at all but offering basic service with not so basic prices the room is rather small but mine had a balcony overlooking the street so it did not feel so cramped i had a good sleep quality mostly due to the memory foam pillows there was not so much noise so i slept rather well checkin and out was smooth and staff did their job correctly i mean not going the extra mile in any sense of the word it is a good 3 star hotel with good service and placed in a great area full of shops and restaurants and at the metro line 14 which is the best in my opinion connecting with paris really fastthis hotel is located in the bercy area the nearest metro stop being cour stemilion line 14  only 3 stops from chatelet making it so easy to get to paris central i took the rer b from cdg airport and changed to line 14 at chateletles halles all very smooth and fast no fuss  for its location i would say that the price is very reasonable the staff were polite and not overly friendly which is fine with me the room and bed is very comfortable kettle is provided in the room with tea coffee milk and biscuits soap is provided by the sink and in the shower but no shampoo conditioner or lotion so bring your own for those reviewers who complained about the size of the room well they obviously have not travelled much around the european cities for me thewe had selected kyriad hotel via the eurostar booking and price was very attractive the best part if the hotel is just 3 mins walk from the nearest metro cour saint emillon  room was little small though and shower cubicle space was quite restricted problem if bather is big size room was clean room wifi is available but has to       relogin back everytime trying to access it after disconnection most other hotel free wifi are autologin after the first setup  hotel offer free storage space for luggages if arrive well before the checkin time nearby there are plenty of food choices we tried one asian restaurant nearby and price was reasonable and food was nice  there is also a rather big supermarket near to the hotel less than a min walk only  hotel breakfastwe had just had a very long and delayed train trip from milan and when we arrived at the hotel at 9pm we were told that our booking had been cancelled and that there were no rooms available thankfully i had my booking confirmation voucher and proof of payment eventually the duty manager accepted my proof of booking and a room was actually found the room was small the shower was very small but the room was clean quiet and comfortable and served the purpose it was intended for  an overnight stay on our way home bar area and staff were very nice i was asked to pay for the room on checkout again the duty manager was too busy to speak to me but i got it sorted out eventually the moral of the story is not to book through a third party  we booked through cancelon who hadnt,amazing experience everything was perfect worth the price  we enjoyed the breakfast they have many options including pancakes waffles and frozen yoghurt the room was clear the place is quiet. For travellers on a budget travelling with family this is a great hotel located in the arrondissement 12 the location is perfect to connect in all paris via metro or bus also daily is offered a generous and fresh breakfast which includes eggs sausages.
Hotel Caumartin Opera - Astotel,this is a hotel very close to opera and gallery lafayette its a 1520 min walking distance from the louvre but as the metro opera is so close you can easily go everywhere the hotel was clean and the room was big enough the people at the reception were so kind and helpful  it is a value for money hotel having in mind that this is paris i spent 4 nights at this hotel arrived early in the morning and was allowed to check in and crash into my room after a long 10 hour flight so was grateful for that i chose the triple room so i could have more space in parisian standards it would be tight if 3 people were sharing closet space is also limited yes the hotel hallways show wear and tear and so does the room mainly scratched on the wall from luggage but it is clean and that is all that counts for me  service is great staff always responsive friendly and courteous location is excellent a 3minute walk tofrom roissy bus station a 5minute walk from the department stores and very close to 2 main metro1 rer station and a few bus stations street is relatively quiet despite being so close to the hustle andmy husband and i stayed at the hotel during the first week of june for our 1st anniversary we chose this hotel because of the location to the shopping mall subway buses hopon hopoff buses and airport shuttle  the hotel was a little bit rundown especially the washroom but we didnt mind the location was absolutely perfect it took only a few minutes to walk to galeries lafayette the food hall served amazing food and the pastries were delicious and other main attractions the breakfast at the hotel had really good croissant the staff were nice in general and the checkin process was easy  despite all the pros the breakfast situation left an

enjoyable and even made it possible to get our room on a slightly later checkout  the rooms were spotless  they have a free soft drink mini bar which is a very nice touch  they have a kettle and some

daily and you can also have a small breakfast downstairs during the day they serve some food and drinks for free which i never tried but its good to know  the hotel is super close to the business district and also a good starting point to explore the city you have appr 20 by feet to the louvre 45 by feet to the eiffel tower along the river seine so its really well located  even though its in the middle of the city it is absolutely quiet at night there is also a supermarket 50m from the hotel  the stuff is also very friendly and helpfulone of the best hotel in parisvery central locatednear

surely will stay heregreat location  close to the opera house and layfayette shopping centre and walking distance to most of the major attractions rooms prob 3 star but breakfast included in price and was adequate  would stay there againhotel is in the perfect location for all you want to see in paris the hotel has everything you could need including hairdryer and free mini bar as well as lovely choice at breakfast and a free happy hour for drinks and snacks room was clean and comfortable hotel staff were super helpful and friendly i would recommend this to others   i would say the bed was slightly too hard for us but we are used to a softer bed and the shower screen was a bit loose but those are only tiny things compared to everything else the hotel has to offersplurging on the hotel was one of the best ideas my wife forced me into while the room wasnt particularly large it was adequate wellfurnished and equipped with a nice firm mattress and modern bathroom amenities the hotel is superbly located less than 5 min walk from roissybus opera and lafayette gallery yet very quiet and its breakfast generous and of high quality deserves a special mention more importantly the hotel offers an open bar from 1400 with considerable choice of snacks fruits and soft drinks  and a similar bar is offered in all 17 astotels properties all around paris the place comes highly recommended tip for a novel window view and quieter sleep ask for inside roomthe start here are all amazing  they really care about you and go the extra mile to make sure you are happy  all the time  the breakfast is extremely well stocked and they have filter coffee for those that dont like espresso shots  there are more choices than many fancier hotels i have stayed in    the rooms are very clean and have a stocked fridge with free soft drinks and water which is very nice  and there is also coffeetea in the room   the one downside is that for all the rooms that face the interior which is all but two the elevator shaft makes a clunking sound every time it moves  and it is a deep and for me loud clunk   i am really surprised that more people dont comment on this  i couldnt sleep though it even with ear plugs  eventually the elevatorwe found the hotel caumartin opera an excellent choice for our 3 nights in paris there was easy access to several different metro lines the staff was friendly and helpful the breakfasts were delicious and the room clean and well supplied  we would definitely stay there againclean rooms and good breakfast close to the opera garnier the reception staff was very helpful with everything that we needed we easily found restaurants just up the street and also shopping areas nearby there are subway stations very close also the bed in our room was large and very comfortable clean sheets and the minibar refilled dailyhelpful staffclean and very close to most of the major attractions ideal for easy access to eating as many restaurants close by the hotel has everything you could need including hairdryer and free mini bar as well as lovely choice at breakfast and a free happy hour for drinks and snacksthe location is excellent  just down the road from havrecaumartin metro the room was spacious for 2 of us and had all the facilities we needed breakfast was a nice selection and the staff were friendly free soft drinks each day is a great bonus  be aware that there are construction works on the facade of the building  this isnt mentioned upon booking or arrival the workmen were on scaffolding literally outside our window all day on the 3rd floor so we could never open the curtains or window making our room very dark and damp after using the shower the workmen began making noise at 815am every single day drilling and banging on our wall and continued this until late afternoon we would not have booked this hotel if wed known this in advancereturned to this hotel after almost a year and found the renovations to the facade still on going   still like this little hotel mainly for its great location for shopping as well as for the restaurants around  the room for a solo traveller while compact is cosy with the ongoing works to the facaderoof which is accessed by the workmen from the courtyard it can get quite noisy after 8am when they start work   the astotel chain of hotels boasts of an open bar concept where clients can have drinks and snacks from 100  1000 pm  unfortunately for me the afternoon i was there a mouse thank god it was not a rat decided to wander in  which begs the question of hygiene as the tarts and pastries are exposed unattended  to the elements and rodents the wholethe bedroom smell rotten the bath plug doesnt work we can hear the people in the other rooms same with the noise of the toilets upstairs every time somebody is flushing the walls are full of humidity not very healthywe stayed 5 nights in a superior twin room in early to mid october and absolutely loved the location which is literally around the corner from paris opera garner gare auber church of st madeleine  place de last concorde etc  its a very short walk up the street to printemps and only a few steps further  to galleries lafayette we actually walked to all of the landmarks including sacred coeur eiffel tower champs elysees  notre dame etc  the location is the hotels best feature  we initially went into the hotel next door because this hotel is very narrow and we didnt notice the entrance which was surrounded by scaffolding the entrance and lobby are are basic no frills and there is one small lift which takes you up to the very narrow corridors    as i said earlierit is my preferred hotel in paris  nice welcoming from the reception  professional follow up if there is anything with the room or with the service they take immediate action to make you a nice stay  olive at the reception is really offering exceptional 5 stars service  she is a very professional  she knows how to handle a guest complaint  problem solver as well lucil at the breakfast room is very helpful and hard workerthe location is very good close to the opera de paris and the department stores like lafayette and printemps but the photos dont correspond to the reality the room smells bad carpets and the bathroom is old  and i think the rate is expensivebooked this hotel as pic look ok and just looking for simple accomodation so wasnt expecting much already but the hotel is more like a hostel of 1 star rather than 3 stars carpets looks dirty scratches on the door and even tiles is broken noise insulation is extremely poor and you cant sleep unless you wear ear plug also its not informed that the hotel is being renovated and there are construction work throughout the day nothing like the picture advertise the towels doesnt look clean also and had to use tissue paper instead  terrible experience would never stay in this hotel again there are much better choice in the area for the price of 180 per night,this is a hotel very close to opera and gallery lafayette its a 1520 min walking distance from the louvre but as the metro opera is so close you can easily go everywhere. service is great staff always responsive friendly and courteous location is excellent a 3minute walk tofrom roissy bus station. the food hall served amazing food and the pastries were delicious and other main attractions the breakfast at the hotel had really good croissant.
Hotel Chatillon Paris Montparnasse,i enjoyed my time at the hotel i travelled to paris from london on the eurostar and eurostar ended up cancelling my return train meaning i needed somewhere to stay for an extra night the lady at reception was very sympathetic and understanding and i was able to stay in the room i had booked for an extra night i had a few problems with the room the plug in the sink kept getting jammed and i couldnt fully close the  window so it got a bit chilly at night as i stayed in december also very important to note the walls are really thin i could hear noise and chatter from other people so loud i didnt really sleep well at night and every morning a couple upstairs would you know creaking ceiling and everything so if you have kids thats something to be mindful of thethe hotel provided good value for our family of four staying in two rooms one room has been renovated and the other was of a poorer standard its close to the metro and there are a few

webs the ameneties for a 3 stars hotel were not providedwe had a friendly welcome from the lady at reception who was very helpful in ensuring the safekeeping of our luggage as we arrived before check in time the room was particularly large for paris and we had a great bathroom  plenty of space there was also a laptop safe in the room which was great to fit in more than just a few small valuables  the staff were very helpful and overall it was a good stay  breakfast was a little pricey at over 12 euro per person and remember to ask for the wifi code at reception as you cant call down for it  we had to run down in pyjamas as they wouldnt read it out over the phoneexcellent qualityprice ratio properly clean and the staff is very professional and welcoming breakfast was good but its not

receptionistmanager as well as the coowner had an arrogant attitude when anmy girlfriend and i stayed in this hotel for one night during our time in paris and i have to admit that we were really impressed with the cleanliness service and specially with the room great decoration really good size good services including nespresso machine and tea facilities all toiletries you may need during your stay etc i cannot rate the breakfast as we had it at the signe cafe just right opposite the hotel and i highly recommend this cafstayed here for christmas and it was good value for money location is good and peaceful room had a nice big bathtub and a good bed overall i would recommend this place if you are looking for a peaceful hotel which is not too expensive in paristhis hotel is a hidden gem tucked away at the end of a peaceful and quiet side street in paris   a group of us spent two nights here over the christmas holidays and i would highly recommend it to anybody visiting paris   i have stayed in a number of three star hotels and i would say that this is towards the much higher end of a 3 star hotel rooms are clean and spacious with all amenities tv heating phone charging points hair dryer toiletries coffee machine free wifi etc the ensuite was also spacious and clean  staff are welcoming very friendly and knowledgeable and they all spoke english perfectly   i would say that the hotel is in the south central area of paris and it took us around 15 minutes via car took to get to the centre of paris so it is wellroom was a little bit gloomy and bathroom was not clean enough we chose for our last day breakfast at extra charge but we were disappointed by the poor quantity and variety provided however staff was nice and helpfulweare veteran travelers but not that familiar with paris after a sudden change in plans we found ourselves on our way to paris on a highspeed train with no place to stay using the train onboard wifi my wife found this place se of the montparnasse station because of the last minute booking the room came out to about e230 wow    the room is fine but small not a surprise the hotel says three stars  in a case like this you have to say okay for this time  no gym of course though breakfast is included     doable but were not raving     the fellow at the front desk is friendly and helpfulgood service great breakfast bathrooms appear to be remodeled  good location only big complaint cleanliness  the walls need repainting the carpet was not vacuumed and worst of all was the large amounts of dust on the curtain rods there is no air conditioner in all rooms its very hot there is only 1 fan 1 room but the fan is too small i ask for 1 more fan but staff said only 1 fan 1 room  the room didnt clean very well they dont vacum it   good value for a few nights in paris short walk to the metro station and then you can go to any of the major sites from there location very convenient staff very helfulwe spent two nights at this hotel it was quiet and comfortable and the breakfast was excellent the neighborhood is safe and comfortable to walk around and there were several restaurants and stores close by it is also located not far from a metro station the hotel was clean the staff was helpful and we had a great staythe first time i booked the hotel i had to cancel the trip when we were finally able to travel again i chose to book it again i was totally right on my bet we received a very nice welcome to the hotel which has a touch of refinement is very clean and we were accommodated in a nice room viewing the main entrance street the neighborhood is quiet but offers options to dine though i did not have time enough to ask for gluten free breakfast they were super attentive to fulfill my need we had a very pleasant stay a restful night and a delicious breakfast it is certainly on my plans to come back to this area and to stay again at the chatillonthe hotel provided good value for our family of four staying in two rooms one room has been renovated and the other was of a poorer standard its close to the metro and there are a few shopsrestaurants nearby the walls are very thin but we didnt have a significant problem the hotel is situated in a quiet culdesacoverall impression is good clean value for money 500mtr from the subway only complaint was the big water mark on the ceiling staff were helpful and charming  could inmprove the television package to include a english news channel other than that would deffo stay here again  well done teamthe hotel building was lovely so stereotypical of parisian buildings and our room window was a door which opened onto a parisian street with the iconic iron balcony the hotel room was small and a bit dated but had everything we needed a fan an small ensuite bathroom we didnt opt in for the breakfast at the hotel as we ate at a french bakery located just around the corner where we could sit and people watch with a caf latte and a pan au chocolate the location of the hotel is a bit out of the way we were close to a metro stop but we were not on one of the main lines meaning we always had to change trains to get to the main attractions and locations this wasnt too much of a problem as the metro runs early in the morning and late into the night there is not much aroundno noise from the street cleen good accesibility to metroiam fully satisfiedwe arrived at 0030 and service was waiting for us with smile i reccomend this hotel with best ratio of pricecomfortlocationthis hotel was a good find it is a typical small parisian hotel but with decently sized rooms it is clean there is no noise from the street at all however the walls inside are thin every single one of the staff was supernice and went out of their way to be helpful breakfast was a treat we would stay here againhotel in a calm area spacious rooms clean environmentwalls are thick but rooms are big and well cleaned upstaff should have been more prepared as they only started to hoover the carpets of our room at 2 pm by our arrival despite of this our stay was nice and this hotel isrecommendedwe stayed 2 nights with family hotel on a decent tube line m4 so easy enough to see the sights but we do like walking rooms spacious and nice shower rooms breakfast was ok  took it first day a little limited next day we did a picnic breakfast carrefour supermarket near by was excellent walls a little thin and heard many bed time noises a little embarrassing with young kids who wondered what was going on next door staff good and helpfulwas there with family for one day before returning to london from easter holidays found this hotel online with the good reviews the landlady was very helpful and nice we booked a large double bed room and price was ok not to expensive as compare to the nearby hotels   good location with many restaurants around and supermarket  within 2 mins walk rooms are ok but not woow then again you get what you pay for bathroom nice and clean the only negative point me and family noticed was the carpet which was filthy not sure may be wasnt cleaned before we checked in breakfast very basic for 1250 if you dont want to spend much on accommodation for short trip then this place would be ideal overall oknice place to stay kind staff the owner was very kind to make our stay so good we will recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to go to paris we will come back again metro is within about 9 minutes walk and a very good point to explore paristoo expensive room for the location related to paris city center the breakfast

i was really impressed by this hotel  it is a little bit out of the way  10 mins walk from the metro line 4 at alesia or porte dorleans  but in a nice area where you wouldnt have any worries about being out late and situated in a quietculdesac  there are lots of acceptable restaurants nearby  my room booked as a single had a generous and comfortable double bed and was particularly spacious  the bathroom had a goodsized shower and just about enough space to do everything else that was needed  an ample supply of towels was provided and refreshed on each of the three days of my stay  although i

Hotel Chavanel,i personally didnt have many negative things to say about this hotel the room was very nice and clean updated good tv decent view nothing special the only thing id say is wrong with the place is the extremely small elevator they have to go up to your room but besides that its a very quiet and nice hotel i would stay here again the staff was alright and i never ate the food there so im not sure if its good or notlocated in an lovely part of paris very friendly and welcoming staff from when you walk in the door very well presented bedrooms with modern shower room excellent selection for breakfast definitely worth staying herei booked the hotel online largely because i loved the location not only was the location fabulous for my preferences but i was extremely happy with the hotel and would stay again i like a room that is bright and airy with windows that open and this hotel fulfilled both of those with the window open i could hear street noise but this isnt an issue for me our room was a decent size by paris standards i was sharing with a friend and we didnt feel constrained by the size of the room i found all of the staff accommodating and friendly our room included breakfast and i was very pleased with the breakfast and the service in the breakfast room lots to choose from to eat and i was in heaven with the selection of french cheese and breads  while

walking distance shopping sights and museums i do appreciate the manager letting me check in early and when there was no slippers in the room she promptly brought one up the rooms are tiny but

my flight and when i asked if the taxi had arrived  the reply was how would i know i thought that was quite a rude answer i work in customer service and would never say that to a customer there is

i discovered it while walking about four years ago and finally stayed there the location is fabulous you are close to all the best shops 5 minutes away from chanel hermes and the department stores close to all the museums and to champs elysees the hotel is small and staff is friendly didnt ask for recommendations since i know paris better than my own hometown  i arrived very early and my room wasnt ready which is understandable i left my luggage and went out for breakfast i arrived on the hottest day of the year so at around 11 am i went back to the hotel and waited until my room was ready the room was nice cozy and clean but small but who stays in the room all day while in parisa friend sent me to the chavanel and im so grateful from the minute we walked in the front desk staff were attheready to make sure we had whatever we needed its really a tiny place but for us that was the big plus  our room was absolutely wonderful with a great view of rue tronchet and it couldnt have been a better location for dining shopping or starting off on a day of sightseeing perfectwe stayed there for a night location was great but it was so noisy that i had a terrible night sleep rue tronchet is very busy at night room is tiny but shower is nice i would classify it as average would not return because of the level of street noisethis is my second stay at chavanel this year the location is perfect so many great locations within walking distance shopping sights and museums i do appreciate the manager letting me check in early and when there was no slippers in the room she promptly

never say that to a customer there is also an asian lady at the front in the after noons and she is quite rude thethis hotel is ideal if you are looking for modern design in a small hotel setting without the services and the hefty cost of the large hotels im this central location in paris many sights like the louvre eiffel tower and the champs elysees are a half hour walk away   the rooms are a good size for paris standards and the staff are friendly and competent   the only negative the breakfast room is very baldy lit one can hardly see what one eats i clearly suggest an improvement here to make the stay perfectmy teenaged daughter and i spent 8 nights at hotel chavanel in march i did a lot of research before choosing this property and i was not disappointed the experience from start to finish was excellent the room while smaller than those found in north america was large by european standards and was decorated in a very chic and modern style the bathroom was large and the shower was excellent  great water pressure and temperature we had a lovely view of rue tronchet and the large windows open completely which gives the feel of having a balcony the staff were friendly and helpful especially as my french is weak to say the least and the location was perfect  the metro is on your door step the shopping at blvd haussmann is a block away and the louvre musee dorsaythe room was really nice newly refurbished like the rest of the hotel location also great but a bit noisy on a busy street if you are sensitive arriving in the afternoon at about 3 i asked for one extra white sheet since there was only a double duvet in the bed the guy said he would fix it no sheet in the evening so i asked again he then said he could not fix it today since he was alone but maybe tomorrow we also asked if they could fix the safe we had to ask three times before they said they could not fix it however the guy coming to try to fix the safe managed to take our key card with him so we had to ask for a new one also some days prior to arrival they sent an automatic email with a form i filled in that i would like to buy metro tickets from them afinding the perfect hotel for your short break trip requires a strategic decision firstly you need one that fits your budget and secondly it needs to be centrally located to maximize the time you have in a destination  chavanel hotel ticked all those boxes and more during our recent stay in the capital of france probably my favorite feature of this concept hotel is its elegant and yet chic decor when we entered the hotel we were impressed by birches in the lobby these interior details made me miss my homeland a whitetrunk birch is considered to be one of the emblems of middle region forests of russia we stayed in a deluxe room which is reasonably spacious for paris it has two huge windows overlooking rue vignon that made it light it was made up of a queen size bedfantastic location friendly staff great little breakfast and nice rooms highly recommend for a stay in paris within walking distance of so many must see places to visit and if you like shopping you will be in heaven aswellstaff at this very small hotel were really nice and gave us a warm welcome  we considered it a bit of a find as it was in a good location for walking to a lot of the main sights rather than using the metro which we found to be very crowded even by london standards  the room we had was very small but fine for a few nights and the toilet was not only separate from the bathroom but in the opposite corner of the bedroom the windows were well insulated and kept the traffic noise to a minimum we had a first floor room and occasionally you could hear a rumbling which i believe was probably the metro passing below or nearby  breakfast was in a cellar room downstairs but there was a fresh selection of food every morning  it was clean and i would return for the locationit is actually not easy to pick a right hotel while you have seen too many beautiful hotel photos online and they all look nice classy or chic within the similar price range  hope my review can help you to narrow down your selections  in 2015 i stayed at sofitel le faubourg and their rooms price raised a lot this july  since 8th arr is where i familiar with so i decided to stay at hotel chavanel   i booked a deluxe room for 4 nights from july 8th  i really like this hotel for their excellent location winthin 5 min to franprix and within 10 min to printemps lafayette and monoprix  the stuff was very friendly and helpful  i felt sorry for travellers who experieced bad services the buffet breakfast area was not big they offered simple and yummy pastries boiled eggsthe location is excellent walking distance to three metro stops many local cafes and eateries shops and what have you the hotel has nice modern dcor lovely and clean when you arrive  the down side which we found really annoying that after a full day of sight seeing our rooms had not been cleaned it happened every day of the three nights we stayed and we found this to be very unusual and annoyingwe stay here for 1 week the room are small but really do we need large room this was a  perfect location and everything was funky fun decoration bed was very comfortable all toiletries were first class staff was all helpful and pleasant breakfast was perfect fresh coffee  juices croissants eggs  salmon cereal etc  even chocolate covered rice cakes perfect for gluten free and very nice young ladys that are theres the help you  this is a perfect location for the right bank gallery lafayette the louvre museum operawith lots of restaurant nearfantastic location friendly staff great breakfast and nice room the location is excellent walking distance to three metro stops many local cafes and eateries shops and what have you the staff was very courteous and helpful i will recommend hotel chavanel thanks for a great stay i am sure we will be backi recently stayed at the hotel chavanel again in the madeleine area of paris i love this little 4star hotel located in a great central area as it is very modern clean and cozy and the staff is normally very nice  this is why i was very surprised when at the morning of check out the personnel at the reception desk implied that i wasnt telling the truth about how many things i had consumed from the mini bar during my stay i stayed for work for almost one week i had consumed two bottles of water but was told that also another bottle of water and a beer had been registered during my stay when i stated clearly that these things had not been consumed by me  i dont even drink beer and that they must have been registered mistakenly i was given a long stare with a slow  r e amy boyfriend and i spent the weekend at hotel chavanel we couldnt have been more pleased with our stay the hotel itself was clean new welldecorated comfortable and situated in a perfectly central location walking distance to all major sites also public transportation available to these sites as well the breakfast was included in the price and was a perfect addition the gentleman at reception was incredibly accommodating and friendly during our stay we will definitely be back highly recommend this hotelmy boyfriend and i spent the night at this hotel during a flying visit to paris it was lovely the staff were very nice and attentive and the room was very clean and tidy it is quite small but it is perfect for a weekend getaway and we would definitely return we walked all the way from garedunord which took about 3040 minutes but it was very well located and extremely straight forward to get there thank you hotel chavanelthe hotel is beautifully updated and renovated with environmentally friendly featuresour room was nicely decorated and soundproofedthe toilet was separate from the shower and sink area which was a bit odd and inconvenient the staff was very courteous and helpful our breakfast was included and was just okthe croissants and bread selections seemed very stale everyday there was some fruit cheese etc but overall was quite underwhelming on the whole though we were very pleased with our stay,i personally didnt have many negative things to say about this hotel the room was very nice and clean updated good tv decent view nothing special the only thing id say is wrong with the place is the extremely small elevator they have to go up to your room but besides that its a very quiet and nice hotel. staff was alright and i never ate the food there so im not sure if its good or notlocated in an lovely part of paris very friendly and welcoming staff from when you walk in the door very well presented bedrooms with modern shower room excellent selection for breakfast definitely worth staying here.
Hotel Chopin,it is the third time we come to the hotel as we appreciate the location in one of the passages and the ambiance of an old paris hotel although the rooms are bit small and would do with a face lift and  the staff is very nice wish the hotel were a bit cheaper though i came to paris for a very rush work trip chopin is located quite conveniently i was able to get to places i need to by metro many lines run by this hotel its comfortable and clean   not giving 5 stars because there are some stairs before reaching the elevatorthe location of hotel chopin is wonderful  within walking distance of many sites museums restaurants  also close to several metro lines rooms are cozy and have what a traveler needs for a comfortable stay  being in the passage jouffroy adds to the charm  might not be good for younger children but a lovely hotel for adults or families with teenagers breakfast is offered and its worth the price just for the fresh squeezed orange juicea quirky little 2 hotel in a well positioned central area of paris handy for arrival from cdg on the roissy bus at the opera well located for a good choice of restaurants excellent patisserie in the passage couple of doors down excellent bathroom towels a little tired good size bedroom with good king sized bed  downside bedroom very warm at night and no ac or adequate ventilation no issues over noise and given location and overall service good value for moneywe had a perfect time at the hotel staff was great the room had a good size the location is really good we walked a lot e there are metro stations near we wish to come back some day and will recommend the hotel to family and friendsroom was nice not overly big but great comfort breakfasts were delicious and the staff were really easy to work with would certainly recommend and would book again merci hope to return some day soonsituated in the heart of paris hotel chopin dates back to 1846 and is located in passage jouffroy a beautiful arcade not unlike the royal arcade or block arcade in melbourne as a born and bred melbournian this was something i particularly loved about the location of hotel chopin  ive given the motel 3 stars and will explain the aspects that have earned them a star  1 staff  staff were very pleasant to deal with and did a great job with cleaning the room daily making sure we had fresh towels etc in addition to the staff there is a gorgeous black cat named clarinette who lives at the motel although she doesnt go into rooms or dining area as a cat lover a resident pet added to the experience  2 cleanliness  and amenities rooms were very clean and effort has beenwarning ive given chopin 4 stars although it is officially rated as two stars and some picky people would think im too generous but i will list the good and bad  you decide firstthe hotel dates back to 1846 and has a lovely patina and sense of fin de sicle it is furnished in early 20th century style quaint quirky loads of character good honeymoon hotel staff are friendly and helpful hotel is kept very clean hot and powerful hot showers and the buffet continental breakfast astoundingly good location is perfect close by two metros and one of the hop onhop off buses stops at the hard rock cafe right next door the hotel is in the passage jouffroy  amazing place too and is very quiet room rates are good for paris there are some negatives though beingthe staff was friendly and helpful the location was great and next to some very good restaurant and restaurants carrefour was round the corner subway station was two minutes away from the gate the station was safe i didnt see anything uncomfortable when i took subway in downtown during my visitthis was my second time staying at the hotel chopin and it was just as great as the first time in 2014  the staff is so helpful and the rooms are so quiet which seems amazing being so close to the busy boulevard  i love the atmosphere the breakfast the quiet music of chopin playing in the background  and now there is a chat noir clarinet who is a lovely presence as well  thank you so much for everythingthe hotel was at the end of a beautiful old arcade in a great area of paris the hotel is very old but has lots of character the rooms are clean and comfortable  the breakfast was nice for 10 the staff are all friendlya very good journey in paris in the htel chopin in a quiet passage near the muse grvin and the grands boulevards  our economics rooms were not very big but very cosy and clean very gentle team et very good petitdjeuners nice stuff at the reception desk clean rooms and a very good bed and after all very silent the nostalgic parisian flair of the house is very charming nice detail  clarinette the cat perfect situation for a short trip to parislovely staff

Hotel Darcet,i booked a 3 night stay at hotel darcet but after i checked in i had an emergency come up that meant i had to depart after only one night  even though i booked through an external website the staff went out of their way to try to help me cancel the rest of my stay  they could have chosen to just say no but they went the extra mile to help  the hotel seems super clean  when i was walking up the stairs i saw the 4 cleaning staff tackling the daily clean including wiping down the outside of the guest doors  at what hotel have you ever seen this done  i was really impressed  i would have preferred it if i didnt have to leave my key at the front desk whenever i departed as a person traveling alone that made me uncomfortable  however the desk does stay open 24stayed here for several nights room modest but clean staff friendly and very helpful thoroughly enjoyed my stay here  bedding excellent could open the window and hear the wonderful street sounds of paris but quiet if i chose to close them extremely convenient to transportation hubs bus metro taxi bike  scooter rentals etc near the place de clichy where there are many excellent outdoor restaurants be sure to take your covid vaccine card  i finally got myt passe sanitaire toward the end of my trip  much easier but both work very well highly recommend little italy which is just up the street and the pastry shop on the corner hotel offers tea and coffee only but you have use of the kitchen refrigeratorwe spent 6 nights at this hotel and found it to be very nice  the staff were all pleasant and very helpful with any questions or requests  we booked a room with 2 twin beds and did not have a street view but instead a view onto the outdoor sitting area  the windows had great black out shutters and were relatively quiet  while it was a small room and bathroom there was plenty of room for the 2 of us to spread out and get ready each morning  you do have to leave your key at the desk when you leave but there is always someone at the front desk  to return your key to you when you return from your day  the hotel has many restaurants patasseries and stores around it  it is about a block and half from a metro station and convenient to walk to many parts of paris  i wouldhtel darcet is an adorable little gem located conveniently near place de clichy and multiple bus and mtro lines its 24hour checkin made coming and going a breeze and the multilingual staff were all friendly and helpful i was surprised by all the amenities on offer given the low rate that i was charged for a twonight stay these perks included complimentary coffee and tea downstairs a communal refrigerator and microwave and a television and blowdryer in the room itself wifi was also free as was one bottle of mineral water per night rooms were exceptionally clean and wellmaintained and windows offered pleasant street views i usually stay with friends when i am in paris but if i am ever unable to i would stay here again with nary a second thought htel darcet isi normally dont write reviews but i wanted to share how great hotel darcet is its a wonderful value for your money is conveniently close to public transportation and located in a cute neighborhood that doesnt feel touristy the staff are friendly and helpful the rooms were just what i needed for this trip and everything was clean and simple i cant recommend them enoughfor all the amenities provided this place was a tremendous value for price paid i loved that it was in a less touristy area yet so convenient with the place de clichy metro stop a quick walk away fabulous bakery just across the street best pan au chocolat ive ever had as well a a larger food market and small organictype grocery right next door the bonus of the shared refrigerator and microwave in the communal kitchen made it easy to catch a quick bite if we did not feel like dining out although with all of the little cafes right on the street great meals were a quick stroll away rooms are small but kept immaculately cleanwhich was all we needed ours looked over a quaint courtyard so street noise was never an issue there is one small elevator but we only usedi have enjoyed my stay at this lovely hoteli plan to come back next time i am in parisi am a solo traveler and always felt safe here  the rooms are clean and linen is changed on a daily basis which i appreciate   the staff are very friendly and welcoming do not hesitate to ask for any recommendations for restaurants or activities in the area i even received a complimentary liter of water   there is plenty of space in the closet for storage i stayed here for 6 days plenty of good choices in the area   unfortunately the time i visited paris the transit strikes were happening so i walked everywherethe louvre eiffel towerarc de triomphe all within 45 minutes distance give or takelovely little hotel in the heart of paris rooms are very clean and cosy across of the street youll find a lovely little bakery many attractions are within walking distance from the hotel  very nice and helpful staff during the nacional strike i got plenty of help from one of the staff members at their reception he made sure that i got the most out of my short stay almost sad to leave but ill be back by june and definitely stay here againstayed for 12 nights and must say that there is a lovely group of staff here friendly and welcoming  this is very important the hotel is in a good location quiet and safe it is close to the subway and bus stops in all directions it is very convenient to walk to the attractions even if there is a strike  my room is clean and comfortable the bathroom has plenty of hot water the tv has many channels you can see the sun through the windows it is quiet and private i like it very much  thank you team darcet for your excellent service the best choice for visiting paris next timeme and my boyfriend have just got back from a 3 night stay here it was our first visit to paris and we were made to feel extremely welcome there wasnt one thing wrong it was all perfect free tea and coffee to use and a kitchen as well the rooms were perfect for us and unbelievably clean i will miss the bed so much its the comfiest bed i have ever slept in the hotel is right near the metro so its very easy to get around and access places such as the eiffel tower overall i wouldnt dream of staying anywhere else we are extremely impressed and the staff who work there are amazingthe real star for this hotel is its location within bagnoilles district of paris with its great array of restaurants and cafes and 40 minutes walk from the louvre the hotel itself has small rooms and does everything well just enough and politely if you after a good value bargain then great if you want any hotel amenities then not so gooda 6 nations rugby weekend was enhanced by our stay at hotel darcet located in a fun filled area but is on a quiet side street the hotel offers spotless rooms with a decent amount of space and good ensuite facilities free teas and coffee are available 247 no breakfast but the hotel invite you to bring in food from any of the local establishments to warm up and eat in the dining room  free wifi that actually works metro station 2 minutes away  all in all an excellent and affordable base to enjoy all that paris has to offerwas clean in my room hallway reminded me of a weird apartment building where someone just left their belongings all over the place wasnt too sure until i actually got inside the room i woke up to someone doing construction on my window 3 stories up which was quite weird good place to stay if you are trying to save money if you are looking for luxury this is not itthis hotel do not have many amenities but three items it had that were important to me location cleanness and price and hotel darcet hit all those items location is near to metro moulin rouge galeries lafayett and many cafes and restaurants also a bakery next door and across the road is a large supermarket which was convenient getting to the main tourist points using the metro or bus is very easy and the staff was helpful especially ziane who was always at the main desk when i checked in we discovered i had booked for july instead of january big mistake fortunately ziane was able to find me the last room for three nights but found me another hotel for me mast night so i was thankful my room is very small and bare bones but clean with white sheets etc thewe have stayed at the darcet for three years running  about two and a half weeks each time   its a marvellous hotel  good location two minutes to metro or twenty minutes walk to the montmartre area good sized rooms for a two star hotel in central paris wonderfully friendly and welcoming owners and clean throughout  i have never come across before  and its an incredible asset a hotel which although it doesnt provide breakfast provides a large room with free tea and coffee where you can eat your own breakfatlunchevening meal theres a patisserie for breakfast opposite and a supermarket within a minutes walk not only the super dining room but a kitchen with microwave oven and fridge for guests use brilliant  going back for 4th year next year and wouldntit might only be 2 star hotel rating but it punched above its weight spotlessly clean rooms superb staff great location within 100 metres of metro would definately stay again if in paris well worth the moneystealing from another reviewer who described this hotel perfectly by saying it punches above its weight for 2 stars very competitive rates and good value for money the desk clerks are very friendly welcoming and attentive location is great and though basic the roombathroom was spacious clean and comfortable rue darcet is more quiet than the surrounding streets and the hotels windows are quite thick so except for what i think was a garbage collection truck at one point weird since it was a sunday morning so maybe it was something else it was very quiet despite facing the street   though perhaps i will request an inside room next time definitely recommendamazing boutique hotel in paris close to the buses and trains as well as plenty of restaurants and bakeries within walking distance you are only 30 minutes away from all of central paris and the price cannot be beat amazing staff fluent in english extemely  clean and plenty of amenities i look forward to staying againthe hotel was perfect in all sense and my stay was memorable i have nothing bad to say other than recommending anyone who visit paris please visit this lovely gem of a place  the place is very clean and spotless has a tv hot shower and ac and also free tea and coffee what else can one ask  the best thing is the lovely accommodating staff who are always there whenever you need anything dare i say they even arranged for my taxi to airport  soumia and samir are the best managers i ever met thanks for all the lovely smiles and all your advice and help  i will definitely visit this hotel on top the area has lots of restaurants and supermarkets  metro and buses are close by and eiffel tower is a walking distance amazing place and very affordablemy wife and i just returned to italy after a wonderful  6 days and nights in paris one of the delights of the trip was our stay at hotel darcet host samir and the rest of the staff really contributed to our stay the hotel was immaculate it was bright and quiet the aircon worked well too i loved coming back from dinner to find samir in the mini lobby seemingly awaiting our return so that he could check on our day and give us each a cold water hotel darcet is super close to the metro easy walking distance to several wonderful bistros close to good groceries a boulengerie and it was a bargain what this hotel may lack breakfast fancy lobby etc it more than makes up for in price friendlyness and convenience we truly enjoyed our stay thank youmy husband and i stayed here for five nights and had a great stay this is a modest hotel but our room was extremely clean quiet and comfortable it had several large windows so was very bright but also had electric window shades so it was very dark for sleeping  the air condizionino worked well and was easy to operate the hotel is managed by samir and he or his sister were often at the reception they were always friendly and often offered us a free bottle of water when we came in after a day of walking  breakfast is not offered but there is a great pastry shop right across the street and a kitchen with a fridge available to all guests they also provide tea and coffee but if you like good strong coffee bring your own nespresso pods  the hotel is very close tostayed here for several nights room modest but clean staff friendly

Hotel Dauphine Saint Germain,love the location and this is the second time we stayed here first time in 2017 however the second time was a very different experience the lobby noise travels to the rooms and the walls are thin do not book room 15 or 16 they should be adjoining also the hotel lobby clerk played the television so loud that we could hear it in our room up one flight thats what headphones are for would not stay here again  and im being generous with a 3 star reviewafter a few rearranged visits due to the pandemic which the hotel staff were very helpful and accommodating with over email we finally got to visit this wonderful hotel we had a great staythe local area and overall location for exploring paris are fantastic and many sights are within walking distance lots of great bars and eateries close by too  metro and bus are also handy rooms were comfortable and well appointed including a really good shower and comfy bed  exactly what you want after a busy day exploring reception staff were all lovely and couldnt have been more helpful we loved the saint germain area and will return to stay at this hotel on our next visit thanks to everyone at the hotel dauphine for making our stay so memorableits a great location old fashioned charm i had waited 2 years to be back in paris and wanted to love it  the staff were lovely front desk folks were helpful  esp patricia no complaints there but maid service and breakfast room sketchytoiletries in room consisted of one bottle of shower gel attached to wall in shower and a little bar of soap which was removed after a few days and not replaced until mentioned at front desk also had to ask for toilet paper after leaving the empty roll visible  towels not replaced consistently and one day the bathmat was a ripped in half towel tables not cleared quickly enough in breakfast room folks waiting having to ask for items to be replenished on buffet choices diminished as stay went onno baguette pieces no englishwow  such a great hotel  everyone was extremely friendly and willing to help us out  they looked up the train station as well as additional information for us to get to chantilly they even printed it out and highlighted important information  they worked with our minimal french and were willing to speak english  they even taught us some french which helped us on the trip  great location  close to the louvre musee orsay notre dame as well as some great cafes  you can easily walk to a lot of the main attractions in paris  i always felt safe in the area  comfy beds and very clean  i will definitely return to this hotel in the futurewe had a wonderful stay at hotel dauphine st germain the early check in email was so convenient once we all arrived we were traveling with 3 families so had 9 rooms booked all but 2 rooms were ready for us early which was quiet a surprise as we did not expect the rooms to ready early the rooms were clean and cool the decor was perfect  what made the stay the best was the friendly service we had from each person working the front desk we were in and out of the hotel and each time we were greeted kindly and always willing to help we will definitely stay at this hotel again  and the location is perfectlove the location and this is the second time we stayed here first time in 2017 however the second time was a very different experience

folks were helpful  esp patricia no complaints there but maid service and breakfast room sketchytoiletries in room consisted of one bottle of shower gel attached to wall in shower and a little bar of soap which was removed after a few days and not replaced until mentioned at front desk also had to ask for toilet paper after leaving the empty roll visible  towels not replaced consistently and one day the bathmat was a ripped in half towel tables not cleared quickly enough in breakfast room folks waiting having to ask for items to be replenished on buffet choices diminished as stay went onno baguette pieces no englishwow  such a great hotel  everyone was extremely friendly and willing to help us out  they looked up the train station as well as additional information for us to get to chantilly they even printed it out and highlighted important information  they worked with our minimal french and were willing to speak english  they even taught us some french which helped us on the trip  great location  close to the louvre musee orsay notre dame as well as some great cafes  you can easily walk to a lot of the main attractions in paris  i always felt safe in the area  comfy beds and very clean  i will definitely return to this hotel in the futurewe had a wonderful stay at hotel dauphine st germain the early check in email was so convenient once we all arrived we were traveling with 3 families so had 9 rooms booked all but 2 rooms were ready for us early which was quiet a surprise as we did not expect the rooms to ready early the rooms were clean and cool the decor was perfect  what made the stay the best was the friendly service we had from each person working the front desk we were in and out of the hotel and each time we were greeted kindly and always willing to help we will definitely stay at this hotel again  and the location is perfectmy husband and 2 adult children travelled to paris in july 2021 for 3 nights while touring several cities in france we were told that the 6th arrondissement was a good area to stay due to the many bakeries and eateries as well as the walkability of the neighborhood we found the hotel dauphin st germain and it perfectly fit our needs the st germain neighborhood was walkable to the notre dame cathedral and the louvre it was safe for my teens to run along the seine in the morning and was highly convenient for bakeries and dinners in the evening  the metro was very close to take us to other tourist spots such as the eiffel tower the staff could not have been more accommodating always willing to give advice or suggestions both day and night we had 2 adjoining rooms  eachgreat location rive gauche just few steps off pont neuf so close to everything that is worth exploring in paris louvre muse orsay shopping and dining areas like st germain and bon marche i enjoyed the vibe in the street it was on with the more normal coffee shops and restaurants the staff was very friendly and accommodating good breakfast french style in an cozy salon the room has everything one needs if staying in paris a great bed and shower to restore after 30000 steps of walking i also had to take some work meetings and wifi was extremely reliable the only thing to know is that street is busy at night and can take a while for things to cool down i was personally not bother but other maybe you cannot have it allwe booked this hotel for a special occasion directly with the hotel and told them we were assured a lovely room communication prior to our stay was very good we were pleased with the location our first room was unacceptable it was dark and dingy we were offered 2 other rooms which none looked like the pictures on their website we paid for an upscale room we paid for breakfast which we were told was a fabulous buffet the buffet was below average if you wanted a soft or hard boiled egg you must cook it yourself there was little variety of cheese cold cuts  or yogurt we had a 4 night reservation and left the hotel after 2 evenings another couple left the hotel as well we checked into another hotel for 50 euros less in the same area received a beautiful cheerfulhotel dauphine my home when i visit paris so charming and accommodating in a great location i think i have stayed there 5 times and they welcome me like family was planning this dec but covid seems to be in my way i highly recommend hotel dauphine a tout a lheurei felt part of france staying in this cozy boutique style hotel it is right in the heart of the tourist area boulevard st michel which is very lively yet the rooms were very quiet the staff was very friendly and helpful and the breakfast kept me going all day major metro lines made it convenient to go all around the citythis is a delightful boutique hotel the room was bigger than i expected in a paris hotel the bathroom was modern and also bigger than usual the staff was friendly and helpful and spoke english the included cold breakfast had meat cheese yogurt cereal and of course  croissants  this is one of the nicest neighborhoods in paris lots of small shops and good restaurants if this is your first visit or you already know paris i highly recommend this hoteli loved my stay here the location was excellent and the staff always greeted you on your return from sightseeing my room was charming with toile de joie wallpaper and wall sconces the bedroom window overlooked a typically french courtyard and the piece de resistance was a small window with a view of half of the eiffel tower  for the price i paid i was delighted if youre used to modern minimalist 5star hotels the dauphine is not for you but it was definitely my cup of tea it also provided everything a good hotel should provide a very comfortable bed clean linen tea and coffee and a hot shower i will definitely stay here again if im lucky enough to return to parisi have stayed at this lovely hotel many times in the past few years the location is exactly what i want close to everything with many shops and restaurants on nearby rue buci the staff at the hotel has always been very pleasant and helpful i have stayed solo and as a party with several rooms and in all circumstances found the hotel to be delightful and practical it is clean and nicely decorated with an elevator good security and wifi  i will stay there anytime i want to be on the rive gauchewe stayed here 2 years ago  could not go to paris this year because of covid but will never stay anywhere else  perfect location and wonderful staff  the room was spacious and the bathroom roomy enough for americans  breakfast was great and the bar made evenings very relaxinggreat location almost everything i wanted to see was just a short walk away  restaurants galore very smart and helpful staff day and night comfortable bed and the bathroom was spotlessly clean and fresh and i am looking forward to the time when i can returnsince i discovered this hotel in paris i didnt tried another one  it is simple perfect localization charming gentle people everything  i cant wait the end of the pandemic to visit my beloved city once again i didnt go in 2020 christmas 2 years ago  my plan was to stay for four days and move on to another part of paris  the room was charming the  breakfast delicious and the front desk person was very helpful  the location was incredible so close to attractions and great places to wander  i ended up staying at the hotel for the entire trip  it is my top recommendation for a paris visitcharming stayed 7 days with my sister im 70she72so were no spring chickens stayed on 4th floor overlooking street at night it was quite noisy from bar a few doors down but what the heckwere in paris her first trip there a few years ago my son took me with his young family and we stayed in very large suites at hotel raphaelalthough i thought it was wonderful at the time id much rather return to this lovely hotel location  fabulous staff fabulous if this covid 19 goes away my sister and i would love to return i recommend it to my son his wife when they go back instead of hotel raphael loved all the bakeries nearby especially smiths also found a laundry mat and grocery store nearbywe walked nearly everywhere took metro to fleai stayed at hotel dauphine in feb 2020 and had a beautiful stay this is my fifth time at the dauphine and as always i had a beautiful time this hotel is in a fantastic area the staff are lovely particularly adrian and najim who are so helpful and friendly if youre traveling to paris you must stay at the hotel dauphinewas at hotel dauphine last week and i have to admit that the set up is charming this boutique hotel is well nestled in one of the best night life street of this side of town beautifully presented for those who like this kind of places it is at a walking distance of almost everything that is interesting this been said first morning there and due to vivid19 i asked for breakfast in the room which i got and had and walked out at around 9 am came back at 330 the room was cleaned but the breakfast tray was still there i had to call and ask for its removal which they did around 6 pm leaving me the dirty cup of coffee the second morning i left at 830 came back after 4 the room wasnt cleaned when i asked why they told me that the personnel already left i then complainedbean meaning to get my precovid travel reviews done  this hotel was really poor  its location spared it from a one star rating  have traveled to paris plenty this place wasnt wellkept or clean again precovid rooms were smaller than the pictures and descriptions would suggest the staff wasnt helpful and half the time i simply couldnt find anyone to ask a question i may be the outlier but this wasnt good  at all no way id go back and no way id recommend to anyonei stayed in this hotel for a week in june 2021 businesspleasure trip with 2 other friends no 2nd key to room was first observed okay breakfast but no iron provided when asked for the location is great to walk to all great site seeing night life restaurants etc the staff was good with english and kind the hotel is a big shabby chic but comfortable the water pressure is great and water is hot the noise outside as there is a pub nearby continues even during weekdays to 2am i would have returned for the costvalue but in leaving i left a hanging luggage insert toiletry bag one where the clear plastic reveals the contents i left it hanging on a hook on the wall not the floor or anywhere near trash  i had valuable jewelry in mine contact lenses skincare and moregreat little location in the 6th arrondissement handy for all the usual big tourist attractions booked online so got a pretty good price the room just like every other hotel room in paris is smaller than expected but it was clean and considerably quieter than other hotels i have previously stayed at hotel staff and front of house service were great very helpful and very informative their recommendations for local restaurants were spot on a big thank you to all the staff at the dauphinelovely place with an excellent location that will allow you to reach almost any attraction in a short time everything was perfect despite the size of the room which is not very spacy the staff was super kind the bed extra comfortable and clean and there is a lovely view on the road ask for a room not on the road if you are bothered by id suggest itduring our time in paris last summer we stayed at the hotel dauphine saint germain  the location was superb down the street from pont neuf and over the bridge to the louvre notre dame and other interesting sites  in the opposite direction sorbonne university and within walking distance to the musee dorsay and eiffel tower  my family was jet lagged and the morning after arrival the hotel staff graciously helped carry up a tray of breakfast items to our rooms  we would recommend hotel dauphine saint germain,we stayed at hotel dauphine st germain first time in 2017 however the second time was a very different experience the lobby noise travels to the rooms and the walls are thin do not book room 15 or 16 they should be adjoining also the hotel lobby clerk played the television so loud that we could hear it in our room up one flight. no complaints there but maid service and breakfast room sketchytoiletries in room consisted of one bottle of shower gel attached to wall in shower and a little bar of soap which was removed after a few days and not replaced until mentioned at front desk.
Hotel Declic,stayed here in feb and did not disappoint paris is amazing and the location of this hotel is superb montremarte is the best area of paris just ask a parisian the hotel was clean very welcoming from start to finish we had room 101 bed was comfortable there was a dressing table somewhere to hang and store clothes shower was superb and clean towels every day i needed an iron again not too much trouble at all we even had our own balcony the local area has some of the best breakfast cafe around get out and explore you will not be disappointed totally in love with paris and montremarte especially we will return and also to this hotel from someone who stays in hotels every week with work trust me this hotel is great bad reviews dont listen to them i read one about frenchinspired boutique hotel very creatively designed and a winner if you love art and photography great location friendly staff and good for couples i liked the lighting and the black out curtains and large bed provided a great sleep the breakfast was a bit simplistic for the pricegreat place to stay very close to moulin rouge  easy access through public transport to other landmarks went with my girlfriend and she was very pleased with the decoration in the room  also had a hot tub which was greati booked this hotel for my partners 30th with it being quirky i thought it would be perfect and by the photos i was so excited with it being a surprise i was so looking forward to it  when we got there they told us we had been upgraded which i think was a complete lie as if there are rooms worse than this one they really need to let people know room 404 first impressions of the room were a wow as it has all the led lighting and little star lights in the ceiling  but as we started to unpack we found nowhere to hang clothes only 2 hooks on the back of the bathroom door not ideal for me as i had dresses i wanted to hang up and wanted at least a draw to put my knickers and socks the room was tiny i have never been to a hotel with no wardrobe or draws the sink waswe stayed for 3 nights in the stargazer room if you are thinking about booking this hotel and you want something a bit different i cant recommend it enough   the room is beautiful and so unique it felt magical to lay in bed with the stars on the ceiling sparkling above us there are stars on the ceiling the floor the walls and the lamps in the room are little planets that cast a gorgeous light the room is a standard size for paris but the decor is so immersive and beautiful that you dont need a bigger room the room contained all the essentials hairdryer mirrors safe toiletries and they quickly provided an iron and ironing board for us when we asked they also looked after our luggage on the last day after checkout which meant we could enjoy the day out and aboutthis is the worst hotel i have ever stayed in i have never written a hotel review but this one is a must so i booked this hotel for my husbands birthday and we stayed one night on the 2930 of january when we arrived the hotel has a horrible smellthink of sewage the guy at the help desk explained where our room was located upstairs with a tiny tiny corridor our room was flirty very dusty and the tv remote was broken held together with a cello tape i went down to complain of how dirty and filthy the room was the guy at the help desk offered us another room which was also dirty and very dark i explained to him that its my husbands birthday and i will like a cleaner and better room he went on to explain that i can pay extra to get a decent room which i did i paidwe came here for our first time in paris we took the shuttle from cdg airport which said 1hr 30mins but only took 1hr the staff at the hotel are very friendly throughout our stay and on the day you leave you can leave luggage with them while you finish exploring breakfast  tasty as long as you are happy just having continental my partner would have preferred bacon and eggs but that was the only downside city centre is very easy access from here theres a train station 5mins walk away max that takes around 20mins we walked the first day but its so inexpensive to get the train its worth saving your feet we also went to disney land that only cost 32 both ways for 2 people and again wasnt a very long journey overall would recommend using this quirky hotel for yourdo not listen to the bad reviews we were worried when booking however have had great communication from hotel since booking from the minute your walk in wow our special anniversary request was fulfilled we have a star gazer room its beautiful so many mod cons inside from different lights sparkly ceiling and floor lighting the bathroom shower has two different type of shower standard shower and rain shower heated towel rail to your required temp whole host of products shampoos etc the rooms are very futuristic open your window and your hear church bells receptionist explains everything in english very well spoken you feel cared for here i will be returning with my childreni had an amazing time at declic hotel the staff were very friendly and kind they were there to assist at anytime the room was everything that i imagined the extra touches requested were also done very well the whole team were extremely welcoming especially andrea and dalila i would definitely recommend this hotel and come here to stay againenjoyed our 2 night stay at this hotel had a boutique room which was stylish and clean i was impressed hotel is near the metro and cafes and shops many thanks to all the staff especially maelle would definitely recommend this hotelbooked this for me and my boyfriends anniversary the room was very small so i cant imagine what the standard room is like we paid for the upgraded room since its quite small we didnt have much room for our suitcases etc rooms looked much bigger online but the bed was very comfy and bathroom was nice enough although some things were dirty such as the fridge and side table as displayed in the photos we spilt a slight bit of wine on the bed sheet the first night so hoped the cleaners would change the sheets we came back to the room later that night to find the bed had been made to look like it had been changed but it had the same red wine stains as when we left the cleaners simply ignored the stain which wasnt hard to miss i think the least i expect from a hotel iswe stayed in the spacethemed room it was terrific we loved every minute the rest of the hotel is nice staff were consistenty helpful and while the 18th arr is not central to tourist paris the area is full of great cafes restaurants and shops the eiffel tower etc is a short metro ride away  this hotel is a quick taxi ride or even walk if you are traveling light from gare du nordstayed here in feb and did not disappoint paris is amazing and the location of this hotel is superb montremarte is the best area of paris just ask a parisian the hotel was clean

tower etc is a short metro ride away  this hotel is a quick taxi ride or even walk if you are traveling light from gare du nordwe stayed in a black double room room is nicely designed and bed was very comfortable pillows were too soft for our personal preference room was fairly clean when we arrived however very dusty on the units and the sink had yellow stains on it carpet unfortunately is very cheap and attracts dust very quickly making the room look dirty as soon as you walk on it we had breakfast included which was 14per day per person personally we didnt think this was worth it as we dont eat meat wasnt much options for vegetarians and we was subject to bread and croissants everyday im regards to the maintenance of the room we felt as though cleaners were very lazy and done bare minimum we had to request that our bed was changed after 2 nights and the tea draw was not replenished thewe choose this hotel because its so different the hotel is clean and tidy breakfast was included and was a great way to start the day the staff here are very friendly and could not do enough for us its only a two minute walk from the metro and has some great bars close by it only takes about 15mins to get to the centre we will definitely come back to this hotel thanks very muchi love hotels with a theme this hotel felt very much like the perfect hotel for teens and a bit futuristic i loved the led lightning that was in the closet and bathroom the overall lightning was really nice the bathroom was also very nice clean and modern  althogh the guest that were stsying in the room on the floor over us threw cigarettes out their window that landed on our little porch real nasty  another annoying thing was that the room key got deactivated 23 times we got help and got a new keycard right away but still a problem that took time and was annoying  the breakfast was also quite expensive if you compare it to what they had to offer to eat  but we only bought breakfast one day on our stay so it didnt bother us way to muchi stayed here as a solo travelled for 5 nights in september i had a reflex room  it was bright modern and trendy the hotel is in the monmarte district and in a lovely and quiet location front desk were lovely  thank you to bouchra who was really accommodating and friendly  would recommend this hotel and would stay here againthis hotel is a great choice in a quiet neighbourhood perfectly placed for anyone who loves to stroll around a city situated on a quiet back street the hotel has an unassuming frontage but inside is a quirky compact and uniquely styled boutique hotel the team at the desk were all super helpful especially bouchra who couldnt do enough to help the hotel is 4 years old and as the decor is mainly black in need of a bit of a touch up and the room could have done with a deep clean in a few spots but towels bedding bathroom etc were spotless it was so lovely to be able to wander out and be only a few minutes from the sacre coeur and dozens of amazing local bars bistros and brasseriesgreat room with lovely design  very quiet even rooms facing the street   wonderful service with happy and friendly staff  very good location in paris with walking distance to for ex montmartre  we will gladly returnis it that im that easily pleased i ask myself but i really enjoyed our few days in paris and i thought the hotel in particular was a great base i loved the photography theme  completely different to most hotels ive stayed in i thought our room was a more than acceptable size was comfortable and was clean after all how long do you actually spend in your room the staff were helpful and friendly  they were more than happy to store our luggage as our flight meant an earlyish morning arrival and gave us useful information for getting to places the metro was close and easily accessed i enjoyed walking around the area and felt you got to see something of the real paris  not merely the bits aimed specifically at tourists so yes you might encounter the oddsmall boutique hotel but good size room great bathroom even while on front of hotel room was quiet excellent bed its not somewhere to go if you want full service but thats covered in the pricewas a bit upset to find no phone in the room upon arrival so he wont able to call the front desk for room service or anything really  would have to go down all the way to the front desk just to be able to ask something i thought he seem to not work every day would go out come back and not he just wouldnt work so would have to go all the way back down again just to get it sorted and that was for every night for the price its good but i wouldnt recommend there is nothing on the website to say about a deposit when we got there we were told there was a 100 deposit that needed to be paid yet we had no information on this site or being told about that but luckily we actually got the money back when we left it seemed like small details were missed out as in your room service doori liked the concept of the hotel and its decoration our room was very spacious the round bed was fun and confortable the room was clean but the bathroom was not in great shape the ac was not working properly the hotel is not sound proofed and you can hear a lot of noise from the room staff was nice and checkinout was quick i will probably not go backchecked in to celebrate the new years eve in paris its a decent hotel with photography as its theme   we stayed in a superior room which is the black and white room its too small has wall problems not suitable for a couple with a baby there is a balcony very dirty and there were cigarette butts all over the bathroom is ok the toiletries arent enough for two people and i noticed some spots on an unused towel  breakfast was okay nothing fancythe standard room is super tiny the windows of the standard room we got are painted without curtains which means that there is no view unless you open the windows if its cold then good luck  people walk right by the windows and can basically just jump in  breakfast is nothing special not worth the money   we didnt feel like this was a 4star hotelwe booked this place through hotelscom when we arrived the guy said he didnt have a room  the only one open was a filthy room that smelled like vomit we absolutely refused to lay on someone elses bodily fluids it was disgusting,The hotel was clean very welcoming from start to finish we had room 101 bed was comfortable there was a dressing table somewhere to hang and store clothes shower was superb and clean towels every day i needed an iron again not too much trouble at all we even had our own balcony the local area has some of the best breakfast cafe around get out and explore you will not be disappointed. bad reviews dont listen to them i read one about frenchinspired boutique hotel very creatively designed and a winner if you love art and photography.
Hotel Duo,ive stayed at the duo hotel paris at least 8 times i have been in 106 countries and i consider this the best hotel in the world customer service is the most important thing for me and all employees are incredible specially stephane they go out of their way to make your experience in paris unique they have the best location in town and the rooms are very comfortable and clean its the best hidden jewel in that city i spent new years there with 17 friends and we felt like at home best new years ever stephane always recommend the best restaurants in town and they also are extremely helpful when it comes to arrange visits to museums or places of interest you will not find a better hotel that this i  duo hotel parismy recent stay at the hotel was last week i have been staying quite a lot in the past years but havent been to paris for a long time hotel duo is located in the marais district with great metropolitan access station is about 3min walk lots of barsrestaurants and shops in the area the hotel itself is a small boutique property with very friendly staff who are always smiling and happy to help rooms some of them could be small but very functional and clean i was on business trip last visit and it worked perfectly for me good breakfast choices would recommend this hotel whether you are travelling on leisure or business and great value for money compares to other hotels in paris that could be very pricy and less confysmallest hotel room ive had in europe it was actually hard to change clothes in in addition to the size the paint was peeling off the walls the bathroom was a disaster ceiling tiles and lights were coming down the bathroom door wouldnt stay closed the sink was clogged the shower head pointed to the wall and couldnt be adjusted  the staff didnt seem to know what they were doing most of the time note that the front and only door to this hotel locks after hours you have to be let in by reception twice we got back to the hotel and no one was there to let us in so we had to wait outside until they got back  also note there is a major construction project right next to this hotel according to friends that live near it wont be done anytime soon they get startedwe stayed  here from may 6 to may 10  2019 our stay was wonderful and the  front desk staff was professional both  anais and stephane the friendliest person was the bartender alexander our room was compact and very clean the housekeeping staff did an excellent job the best feature was that closeness  to the attraction we attended walking distance to the metro subway the seine the louvre and a nice hour walk to the eiffel toweri chose this hotel based on location area and convenience to metro and bus lines the pictures online  fyi pictures on their website can be deceiving  the staff was really friendly and very accommodating the property looks sleek and modern in the lobby and in the rooms if you look from afar  the room up close was another matter i travel frequently in europe and know rooms are small and that wasnt the issue  this room looked like it hasnt been cleaned properly the rug had white specks of dirt the bathroom is in need of a good cleaning some walls look like they had some water damage bathroom was in need of some serious recaulking and needed a paint job as the water and steam have affected some of the wood trim  plus it seemed grimy by the looks of it they didntstayed with our kids in july  staff was nice but not very knowledgeable or willing to offer help or suggestions  excellent location however very loud and busy  room was odd super tight space especially for 4 people  would never recommend or stay here againi was staying at the hotel with my mom and we had a very disappointing experience we were expecting a 4 stars hotel but the feeling is an average 3 stars hotel the staff at the front desk wasnt so nice a specific guy the rooms are small as most of paris hotels but no environment or something special inside to make up for the size we had an ear plug not ours of course under the bed a towel with stains on it beside those stuff the room was clean there is no value for the high pricethis was my 3rd time staying at this spot i am always greeted by friendly smiles and helpful staff the rooms are small as are all rooms in paris the hotel is very clean reasonably priced and in an excellent location  i used their taxi service last time to the airport was told it was a flat price but when i got there the driver insisted on quite a bit more and he dropped me far from the door in an unusual spot so he could avoid the traffic at the doors i was uncomfortable and paid the higher price to get goinglovely hotel in a great location especially if you want to explore paris on foot the rooms are slightly small which is normal for paris but clean and modern and well airconditioned  which we greatly appreciated during the heat wave staff are very friendly and eager to helpi stayed in the deluxe room facing the street and got woken up a few times each night from the street sounds  insulation is not impressive maybe due to the visible gaps in the window frames   the room was spacious but the cleanliness was not of 4star level  there were a few areas that have not been cleaned thoroughly enough  the bathroom was spacious but broken tiles burnt light bulbs and a filthy hair dryer couldnt be ignored   the personnel were friendly and attended to requests although on one occasion i was given the key to another room by accident  there was dirt around the window frames and the ac ducts although the ac was effective in cooling the room above issues aside the location is excellent and was the main reason why i did not check out earlierive stayed in many hotels on both the left and right banks but i keep returning to the hotel duo where ive stayed 4 times  even though the rooms are on the smaller side but not the smallest ive stayed in paris the location and staff thank you front desk  juliette anaiis dany fadi  alex in the bar are always helpful and welcoming  special thanks to stphane who is invaluable in keeping things running smoothly at the front desk  other return guests such as myself have commented and agreed that one of the reasons why we all return is because of stphane whose warm personality and expertise are a definite asset to the hotel the contemporary feel of the hotel situated in the marais is across the street from le bhv dept store surrounded by restaurantsmy initial experience was very poor with a lady in glasses by the name of annais after a 30 flight no needs someone to be arrogant rude and abrupt every question of which there were 2 her aggitatiobn grew in the form of a cynical and condescending response this i occurred on 2 occassions apart from her the rest of the staff are absolutely amazing going above and beyond expectations special mention to stefan who really was a host with the most as well as the other front desk staff also the housekeeping staff particularly the head lady were more than generous the location is incredible walking distance to all events and locations and clean very small rooms but adaquetethe staff were great friendly and helpful good ambience in the reception and bar area room was modern clean and well decorated there was a music festival on whilst we were there and we could not hear the noise as the room was quite even though it faced a busy street we felt that the hotel was well located and the standard high for the price paid we would stay againastonishing to find a hotel this awful in the heart of the marais my room was on street level behind the reception with no windows that open or air circulation on the busiest most unpleasant corner in the marais rude arrogant service really nothing positive to say about this placehotel duo is in the hear of all the action in le marais district staff at the hotel were very helpful and their restaurant suggestions were very worth it   my room looking out the window i can see norte dame     the only thing difficult was the room key which is a key fob after about the second day you get used to it  breakfast was very good and worth it if you are out   the neighborhood seems always busy even after hours and there is no shortage of bars or restaurants in the areathe location is great in a busy vibrant area the reception staff were all friendly and helpful  however we booked a family room or room with an extra room and pullout sofa bed as we were traveling with our 2 children when i opened the door the smell of cigarette smoke took my breath away in the first room that you entered with the pullout sofa bed where my children were supposed to be sleeping it absolutely stank like a 3day party had taken place in there i fully appreciate this is not the fault of the hotel but when the cleaner was preparing our room they absolutely must have realised this i opened a window and went to reception to complain they were very apologetic and i said i would leave them to sort something out and left my bag with them expecting theywe visited paris last november for a business trip enjoyed the hotel very much  very clean modern design  very good location very friendly and helpful staff  i forgot a personal item and the hotel rooms manager sent it to me to my local addressive stayed at this hotel on several occasions in the past and after a 10 year gap i returned to paris for a few days and booked again i was not disappointed the location is just excellentpompidou is a block away bhv literally opposite le marais notre dame etc are a short stroll and everywhere else a quick metro ride away i was in town for work but even being tired at the end of the day getting out to eat and sightsee in the evenings was effortless the hotel has a contemporary boutique feel  stylish but subtle and nicely updated since my previous visits the staff are friendly and extremely helpful and my room was modern and comfortable  i opted for the express breakfast each morning which offers juice coffee and a selection of wonderful fresh breads andnicely decorated a boutique hotel conveniently located in the heart of paris  the rooms are not very spacious but well furnished  bathroom was clean well maintained and with nice amenities  the wifi works very well a must for business travelerswe have spent many years in bbs in paris and found some great ones this of course with the proximity to all we love is more expensive but we will never book anywhere else now the room the bar the staff all exceptional we had a few problems with the wifi and would think this is not a permanent thing lovely place and we will be backi had never stayed in le marais before and this was the perfectly located hotel to do that with   chic clean hotel with lovely staff members   room 18 is the smallest double room but the size was just right for a single traveler   comfortable bed terrific wifi  excellent water pressure etc   i would stay here again the next time in paristhe rooms at this hotel are very small but again that is common in paris  good location if you enjoy the gay life in paris  the metro line 1 is right in front of the hotel  friendly staff very helpful too  in general i had a pleasant experience  will recommend this hotellowerfloor rooms facing the street have external noise echoes of conversations on the street all night long even on the side street with windows closed the hotel really needs doubleinsulated windows to block it out rooms  bathrooms are tiny but clean on the plus side we did not have to wait until the offiical checkin time to be assigned a room but our emailed request for a high floor was not acknowledged upon arrival  we were too tired to make a fuss but we should have for our own comfort  the duo is welllocated in the marais making it convenient to all types of dining from crepe stands  falafel shops to restaurants in all price ranges the pitch black hallways no windows have motionsensors that turn the lights on when you enter but they are a little slowperfect location very helpful multilingual and friendly staff with a good sense of humor and 24 hour desk assistant  good value breakfast and comfortable rooms  if you are sensitive to sound ask for a back room  dont forget your swimmers for the sauna  looking forward to my next tripthe location is great in a busy vibrant area the reception staff were all friendly and helpful  however we booked a family room or room with an extra room and pullout sofa bed as we were traveling with our 2 children when i opened the door the smell of cigarette smoke took my breath away in the first room that you entered with the pullout sofa bed where my children were supposed to be sleeping it absolutely stank like a 3day party had taken place in there i fully appreciate this is not the fault of the hotel but when the cleaner was preparing our room they absolutely must have realised this i opened a window and went to reception to complain they were very apologetic and i said i would leave them to sort something out and left my bag with them expecting theyi had never stayed in le marais before and this was the perfectly located hotel to do that with   chic clean hotel with lovely staff members   room 18 is the smallest double room but the size was just right for a single traveler   comfortable bed terrific

Hotel Elysees Regencia,stayed in october so only just got around to writing this cant fault the hotel staff were lovely friendly and helpful location is good for sightseeing breakfast good spread  the room was spotlessly clean beds were comfy shower wasnt the best design but small detail  would definitely stay there againin this hotel for just two nights and within 5 minutes i already want to check out one colleague has a leaking shower constantly dripping and making noise the hotels solution bring up a plastic bucket to catch the water  next no irons in the room requested over the intranet no answer go downstairs to politely ask for one the answer non tomorrow explain that i just need an iron for my clothes for work tomorrow non tomorrow aparently its my fault for not checking in before they had given out their only three irons in the hotel   very rude receptionist the very type of person that makes people not want to travel to france definitely wont be backfirst i need to say when you arrive in paris and you wish to take a taxi to this hotel it should only cost you 25 eu at the most and make sure your driver as the meter on a lot of dodgy taxi drivers at the station  the location of this hotel is off the scale amazing just perfect in every way close to all the sights if you dont fancy walkingthe bus is better choice than metro and cheaper this hotel is small but lovely clean comfortable and homely the breakfast was delicious people would probably want more selection however my family thought its just right and healthy the rooms are great size very clean and the beds are amazing the girls said best sleep ever unconditional thanks to ali and team you made our stay so welcoming and nothing was a problem you were sonothing special about this very average hotel really basic zero effort i guess the location does it all  more a 3 hotel based on my experience its a boutique hotel run like a giant generic hotel so i really dont see the point staff is polite but cold they dont seem very happy to work herehave been coming to paris quite a lot these past few years and i must say this is a gem of a hotel tucked away in the heart of the city it is a few minutes away from champs elysee and the eiffel tower the rooms are worth the price you pay for and the staff i must say are friendly and professional the breakfast is great and the 2 lovely ladies preparing them were just cheerful of you are looking for a mid range hotel then this is the ideal one what i appreciate the most are the tiny details like the coffee machine in the room that is fully stocked and ready for an espresso when you wake up will be back for surestayed there on a 1 night trip in paris the place is very well located close to champs elyses and provides all you need the hotel is very well decorated rooms are nice comfortable and very quiet breakfast is perfect staff is really willing to help and support you a very good place for both business and tourism will definitely try and come backi was originally booked at this hotels sister property hotel tilsitt i was extremely lucky to be rebooked at this hotel at the hotel tilsitt price i had a large room with french doors that opened up to the avenue the hotel is under a 5 minute walk from the middle of the champs elysees the hotel was super clean housekeeping was adjusted due to covid but everything i needed was replenished daily one of the managers melissa was lovely and helpful before we arrived to reconfirm our plans the front desk staff was kind and patient with all of our questions they even printed out our covid tests to fly back to the united states there is a pharmacy across the street from the hotel that performs antigen tests for a small charge the staff all followed covid rules wellstayed in october so only just got around to writing this cant fault the hotel staff were lovely friendly and helpful location is good for sightseeing breakfast good spread  the room was

comfortable and very quiet breakfast is perfect staff is really willing to help and support you a very good place for both business and tourism will definitely try and come backmy family spent three nights in this hotel in july the rooms were very clean the sheets were soft the bathrooms were great the view was perfect we felt very close to everything and yet our rooms were very quiet i was able to get adjoining rooms for my two boys breakfast downstairs every morning was a huge convenience the kids started each day of walking and touring paris with a healthy meal there was something everyone couldwould eat  the staff was very helpful and friendly we will definitely returnwe stayed for 2 nights in october in the blue suite and our sons had the deluxe room next door to us we booked through secret escapes and therefore the price was reasonable  the hotel ground floor is well presented with the bar and two other separate seating areas the receptionist was friendly  the blue suite on the 6th floor was large enough for all 4 of us to relax in when we were not out exploring the city  we did note that the furniture and carpet are not as shown in the photo on the website but were a bit less smart  had a lovely soak in the bath and enjoyed the multijet shower  our boys next door found the vivid purple decor not entirely to their taste but they are 13yearold boys their room was pretty big and had a good shower room   we ate breakfast boththe location is perfect it is very easy to walk many places the rooms are okay and clean id like having a nespresso machine in my room although they dont have it in the room you can always use the nespresso machine in the lobby for free  there is also no iron in the room the staff immediately provided it to me the staff was always very helpful and kind the breakfast was also pleasant i recommend itwe enjoyed our stay at this hotel clean and friendly it was located really good next too the tour eiffel and other grate attractions great service at all time cosy warm colourful entrance the breakfast area was super nice in the basement really good planned hotel thank youvery good experience the room was clean and well furnished there was a nice balcony there was a welcoming gift 4 yummy macarons   location the neighborhood is quite and nice very close to eiffel tower maybe 1015 minutes and the same to the arc de triomphe and champslyses there are  restaurants laundromat and carrefour nearby  staff nice and friendly  breakfast was good   what i did not like  the toilet is separated from the rest of the bathroom  the shower glass is not very helpful and you cant avoid a wet floor  no refrigeratori booked this hotel because the pictures seemed nice and it appeared to be a good option with a very good location however upon arrival the room given to us was very different from what we expected it seemed like a room from de 80s furniture old the bathroom also when taking a shower the water inevitably came out and the bathroom floor was flooded because of this we asked for another room ali at reception was very helpful and helped us move to another room which was much better and that had been renovated breakfast was very good all staff members were kind location is very good the bed was not the best the mattress felt old and was not firmthis hotel is just 3 blocks away from larc du triomphe staff is very friendly the room was really pretty clean and had an excellent view   price is really fair  i would definitely go back to this hotel in mi next trip to this beautiful cityi picked this hotel largely because of its proximity to the lido it certainly lived up to this as it was only a short walk away it was also a short walk to the arc de triomphe   the hotel itself is lovely the reception staff were really helpful and nothing felt like too much trouble i arrived early having had a particularly stressful journey on the thello sleeper train and they couldnt have been more accommodating they arranged an early check in and provided coffee and pastries while i waited my luggage was put in my room ready   the room itself was simply perfect i felt instantly relaxed the bed was so comfortable and the bedding felt luxurious the toiletries were all loccitane and smelt divine there was a dressing gown hung on the door which was a lovely touchlovely hotel in a tree lined avenue right next to champ de elysees we were on the 5th floor with big french doors leading to the balcony the room was beautiful with one king bed and one rollaway for the three of us the bed was very comfortable and the air conditioner worked great it was on a quiet street but minutes from all the attractions and the tour buses the eiffel tower was a ten minute walk and arc de triomphe was a five minute walk very affordable for such a great location very friendly staff gave us free water bottles thru out the stay will definitely come back has a bar and breakfast which we did not usevery average hotel close to shops and restaurants but no good services no tea place no coffee no drinking water clean rooms but old furniture no room service to provide you with what you need it was an experience bad for meafter check in the valet accompanied us to the parking  the hotel is at walking distance from the arc de triomph the river seine and the shops of champs elysee  room was okay bathroom was small but clean in the room you can hear everything of the corridor staff was friendly breakfast  in the basement  was fresh and cosywe stayed here back in 2008 and wouldnt choose anywhere else for our 2nd visit to paris this time my wife and i were with my parents and our two children  we opted for the excellent blue junior suite on the 6th floor with a deluxe room next door for my parents both rooms had a view of the eiffel tower which was brilliant  the hotel is in an excellent location for all the sites and the service we received while visiting the hotel was really good  i would highly recommend the breakfast at the hotel which saved us having to source somewhere to eat every morning that would have met the needs of our children the breakfast in the hotel had plenty of options that they enjoyed  a special shout out to urmat on the front desk who helped me with everything from booking the stay toi was extremely happy with staying with hotel elysees regencia  the service was excellent and the room was very clean  the bed and linens were extremely comfortable which made for a restful nights sleep  i would recommend this hotel to family  friends as its easy walking distance to all attractions  spending a number of visits to paris for work in recent months i was really pleased to find this gem its location is fantastic  5 mins walk from the champs elysee and despite being so central feels less so the rooms are good for space and amenities and the breakfast downstairs is fantastic way to start the day this hotel always feels a little home from home and welcomingthe hotel is in the middle between eifel tower and arc de triomphe the stuff is frindly the rooms are clean the rooms on the backside are very quit the bathroom an the toilet are very small in the toilet room you cant close the door if you are inside the breakfast is expensiveloved our stay here thought it was great value for money and the location was perfect would recommend staying here the staff were brilliant as well and made us feel very welcome and nothing was a problem also loved using the hamam sauna that was available on request at no extra chargei was originally booked at this hotels sister property hotel tilsitt i was extremely lucky to be rebooked at this hotel at the hotel tilsitt price i had a large room with french doors that opened up to the avenue the hotel is under a 5 minute walk from the middle of the champs elysees the hotel was super clean housekeeping was adjusted due to covid but everything i needed was replenished daily one of the managers melissa was lovely and helpful before we arrived to reconfirm our plans the front desk staff was kind and patient with all of our questions they even printed out our covid tests to fly back to the united states there is a pharmacy across the street from the hotel that performs antigen tests for a small charge the staff all followed covid rules wellwe stayed for 3 nights and were blessed to get a free upgrade to a superior room nice size room and large bathroom with bathrobes and rose petals the works we did have very noisy people above us slamming doors al 3 nights till after midnight however this could not be blamed on the hotel walking distance to red bus stop arc de triomphe and champs elysees shopping street  about 1km to eiffel towerwe took our 15 year old daughter to paris for the first time and we elected the junior lavender suite our room was on the 1st floor and it was spacious and comfortable   the rooms were seperated by drapes but that kind of added to its charm  we had a king bed and the other was a twin   there is a shower and tub with toilet in a seperate area  the only drawback for us was that the stairs by the room and starting about 7am you can hear people coming down breakfast is not included and seemed a bit pricey   the staff was courteous and helpful   i would stay here again,stayed in october so only just got around to writing this cant fault the hotel staff were lovely friendly and helpful location is good for sightseeing breakfast good spread  the room was spotlessly clean beds were comfy shower wasnt the best design but small detail  would definitely stay there again.
Hotel Elysees Union,beautiful charming hotel i had a good stay ideally located for my business meetings i loved this hotel for its beautiful view of the parisian monuments the staff were also charming the check in was fast very good restaurants in the neighborhood i will come back with my family soonstayed here for 3 nights with my best friend and her family for a girls holiday location is good for the eiffel tower and arc de triomphe we had an apartment within the hotel which slept 6 there were 5 of us and it was spacious with 2 bathrooms lovely kitchen with tea and coffee facilities the room was quite hot at times but we opened the window and this was fine staff were friendly couldnt fault the room as we left there were charges for water on our bill which we had not had these were removed straight away without argument a very enjoyable staycontinuing our firt foray to europe we hoped on a train leaving amsterdam  we head to paris for a 2nd leg we stayed at this nice quaint hotel in the brasserie area a stone throw away from the arc  chomps elysees it was a small hotel rooms small also but service was very good staff vert helpful very friendly contrary to popular belief french people are arrogant  impolite hotels location top notched very near the metro trains making your planned site visits easy i recommend this hotel if you plan to visit parislovely hotel with views of the eiffel tower from many rooms and the street located perfectly between trocadro and the eiffel tower very walkable rooms are clean and was surprised by the storage in a european hotel my daughter and i had plenty of space staff is very friendlyw were greetd by the very friendly staff upon our arrival the flight from dubai landed at 9 am and our checkin time was not until 2pm meaning our room was not ready howeever the friendly staff let us put our big luggage bags in a secure and locked room behind the check in desk which was amazing we then had the option to walk around the champs elysees for a bit the location of his hotel is amazing it is walking distance to the eiffel tower and the arc de triomphe and is located next to amazing hotels and restaurants there is also a convenient bus stop down the road the hotel breakfast is not free at the time of our stay but was amazing the options were not exactly huge like you would experience at a hilton or marriot but they tasted amazing featured all types of coldfirst trip to paris for family and gradmother  staff at front desk is wonderful  extremely friendly and personable we stayed in a family apartment  the extra room was great for 2 kids  beds are low to the floor americans  hotel does not supply was cloths bring your own if you prefer   breakfast was included in our rate  great way to start our day and ful range of choiceswe have had the most amazing stay here over christmas   a charming boutique typically parisian hotel right in the heart of it all i have travelled with my daughter who is in an electric wheelchair and we had equiptment delivered to the hotel i knew this was a typical parisian hotel thats what i wanted  via phone calls and emails victor and suzan who were were so efficient they arranged everything perfectly even a taxi to collect us  customer service at its finest we even had a room with a balcony that looked onto the eiffel tower so beautiful to wake up to and watch lit up and sparkling on in the evening 15 mins walk away to the tower and the arc de triomphe perfect destination surrounded by restaurants bars and supermarkets the room was typically parisian but ait was hard to judge this one properly as the train strike in paris really took a lot away from the trip we were lucky that from here we could easily walk to champs elysees and eiffel tower the hotel was quite old and dated however the amenities were good for the price we had the 2 bedroom apartment which had two bathrooms and an old kitchen with a washing machine which was handy the breakfast wasnt too bad either thete was some noise from works going on that woke us 2 mornings but they were next door would stay again if we had the family or on a budget if i was just with my wife would likely go a little more up marketwalking down the street to a view of the eiffel tower was amazing the hotel room was gorgeous great location to champslyses and of course the eiffel tower i was part of a hen party and staff got us all checked in and sorted very quickly breakfast was fine as well id say this hotel is well above 3 stars   highly recommended and would return againlast minute weekend birthday  break with my daughterabsolutely fantastic from beginning to end paris amazing this hotel so well located spotlessly clean lovely and warm and the reception staff are all fantastic best wishes steff and savannah xa good choice in central paris only 600m to the arc de triomphe worth knowing that the charles de etoille metro stop by the arc de triomphe will also give you good access across paris and also the rer a line train service out to marne le valle disney the hotel receptionists speak good english the breakfasts were substantial  with nice continental options crosisant pain au chocolat baguette cheese ham salami etc but also a range of yogurts and cereals the rooms are clean functional well maintained if perhaps a little dated in style the two bedroom apartment we stayed in had a double bed in one room plus ensuite and flat screen tv two single beds in the other room and large central lounge which had a good sofa bed the apartment had a seperate smallthis is an average hotel in a very good location it is located between the arc de triomphe champ elysee and trocadero where you can view the eiffel tower it also near a pharmacy and couple of restaurants and in between 2 stops of big bus tourwe spent a couple of nights at this hotel and were not disappointed the location is ideal  lots of main attractions within walking distance including eiffel tower arc de triomphe champslyses louvre also very close to charles de gaulle rail station which took us straight to euro disney subway line close by too for those who prefer not to walk everywhere  the hotel itself is small and friendly we are a family of four  kids are 13 and 11  room was comfortable enough with a double bed and 2 single camp beds kids said they were comfy enough room wasnt huge but bigger than wed expected after reading the reviews hotel staff were very helpful and gave us lots of good advice about trains and best walking routes etc  taxi from the airport to hotel was a fixed price ofwe stayed in this hotel as a family of 4 in a quadruple room the room was located at the front of the hotel so we could see the famous tower from our window  amazing i had requested a room at the front and was really pleased that the lovely reception staff honoured this   the best thing about this hotel is the wonderful location you really feel like you are staying the chelsea of paris beautiful architecture and so close to champs elysee arc de triomphe  10 minutes walk  and metro system   breakfast was plentiful and more than ample staff were really welcoming and lovely to our girls who loved the sweet bowl on the reception desk   i would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and would love to stay againnice small hotel you can walk to the arc of triumphe and champs elysees from here also if you are taking the big bus is a stop right at the arc of triumphe witch is very convenient rooms  are clean and they have a small variety breakfast in the morning but good enough to start the day and go to explore the city they dont have a restaurant so you have to go out for your meals but there are restaurant around you have a view of the eiffel tower witch is nice if is your first time in paris elevator is very small you may have to take two trips to bring your luggage up to the room we got there early in the morning so they storage our suitcases in a room so we were able to star our adventure helpful staff and they have shuttles to the airportthe room was not that big but it was clean fine and quiet what i love was the location eiffel tower and arc the triomphe are just a few meters awaythe place is also sorrounded by good restaurantswe have a planned trip for our 13 year old daughters birthday in april a few days in paris taking in the sights i have tried effortlessly to contact the hotel as our 10 year old son is chronic asthmatic and with covid19 and the uk in lockdown as well as paris spain etc this disgraceful institute of a hotel are still encouraging my family to travel even though they know about the worldwide pandemic i have asked several times for a refund but been refused point blank money grabbing at a new low im unable to change my trip to any other time due to annual holiday leave if they had shown more empathy to the world wide pandemic and a genuine care for their customers i would have gladly rebooked with them once the world is back to normal i would strongly advise not to stay inthe overall experience was no more than average at best we have both done a fair amount of international travel so we are familiar and totally fine with smaller hotel rooms from time to time that being said this room was very small bathroom as well the location is good as you can walk to many locations you would want to see in paris and walking out of the hotel to see the eiffel tower is definitely a plus   that being said the red flag for us was coming back to a room door that was left open by the cleaning crew the room door must have not shut all the way as they left the room innocent mistake however obviously many of our belongings were in the room all day and this couldve been a bad situation for us when we brought this to the attention of hotel staff thewe recently stayed here wonderful hotelclean roomsfriendly and helpful staff great location in the city close to the effiel tower and other attractions great resturants right down the street close to lovely cafes for the great people watchingthe location is the only good thing going for this hotel  i understand that hotel rooms in europe are small however this was beyond small we could not believe how small this room and the bathroom was  the window opened up to a dark tunnel of ugly concrete walls of other buildings we had just checked in after a long flight from the usa and were in the room about 20 minutes when a staff member just walked right in on us  no knock at the door nothing  when i asked why she said she was just checking in on us weird we could not get the safe to work and all of the staff that we came across at the front desk were rude and unhelpful as far as recommendations or directions go without a doubt we would not stay here againperfect location for easy access 3   small rooms double bed room and single bed in the same room you need to push the single bed to be able to open the window breakfast very limited and i mean very limited coffee machine tea 1 type off cereals  boild egg 1 small plate 2 slices off salmi and 2 slices off bacon orange juice and apple juice each table 1 bascket with few pastries products and

location is perfect for getting around and sight seeing also for restaurants and supermarket  carre four  we stayed in a triple room myselfpartner  son whilst it was a small room it was perfect for our 3 nights  any longer though  i think we would have struggled for space the staff are exceptional everyone really friendly  helpful  their english leaves me ashamed of my standard gcse french  the breakfast is enough to get you started on your day the bed was very comfy and we all slept well  we would recommend and definitely stay here againi was due to celebrate my 40th birthday at this property in march 2020 unfortunately partway through our european trip border closures and selfisolation rules became enforced so our longawaited visit to paris came to an end before we even got to france i called the property to see what options were available for us  not expecting much but they refunded our prepaid booking they were also really compassionate over the phone despite the fact that they themselves were impacted by what was happening thank you hotel lyses union  we will be back when things return to normalbeautiful charming hotel i had a good stay ideally located for my

Hotel Felicien by Elegancia,the breakfast is very expensive  it should be included with the room fair the staff is surprised every time we ask for something missing from the room the staff should be more welcoming and ask the guest if they need anything in brief the customer service is not at a global levelwe booked the room with the jacuzzi on the rooftop and we had by chance a lovely weather  a private terrace just for us  the breakfast is just amazing you can not even compare it with breakfasts in others hotels  the staff is friendly and helpful  we didnt enjoyed the spa but it seems to be a intime and romantic placei highly recommend the hotel felicien in paris  conveniently located within walking distance to both roland garros and also to the the eiffel tower area  contemporary chic and clean with terrific guest service  paloma was especially helpful at the front desk  my 5 night stay there was absolutely wonderful  i will definitely stay there againvery expensive for what is offered nice location in terms of access to the city however not too easy to walk downtown  small room with bathroom split in two wc shower when going to the wc you should go through the main bedroom to wash your hands  no area to sit and relax apart from a very small bar  the spa or small swimming pool is actually charged extra at 30 eur breakfast with limited opportunities for choice had saucage but no baconlocated in a quiet street near a fashionable area close to the oecd the hotel has had the attention of a bold decorator bright colours and thumping patterns make it visually memorable the hotel is friendly enough but needs to master better  some of the basic skills such as calling taxis and ensuring that baths drain properly excellent location for a quiet stay my experience may not be representativewe booked a last minute trip to paris when i was visiting my husband while he was working in germany we needed to change our hotel reservation by one night at the last minute and the staff was extremely accommodating given the short notice on our part we booked the gourmet getaway package and our room came with a bottle of wine free breakfast and a voucher for a free meal in the city at a restaurant of our choice they even decorated the bed with flower petals paloma was very helpful in getting us checked in and answered all of our questions the breakfast buffet had a very nice spread and the overall atmosphere of the hotel is so fun and comfortable 20 minute walk from the eiffel tower and very close to plenty of restaurants and cafesgreat place to visit it is a place where technology is open for all technology has become a major role in our life so technical things are smartly developed in here in this place we know the oldest technology thingsplease do not book this hotel avoid at any cost unless you are being chased by zombies in paris rooms are old and tired the swimming pool is shut for maintenance staff are very french and provide little or no service if you have to book this hotel due to friend or colleagues pressuring you do not fall for the hot tub the hot tub on the roof its open to the elements and to most of the neighbourhood the hotel rooms are very close to the other neighbours you can see them cook in the evenings   there are no decent restaurants in the area the breakfast is basic looks good taste bad i know its paris but yes they found a way to source bad food in franceas a family of 2 adults and 1 child we have spent 1 night at hotel felicien among the positive sides of our stay were fast checkin room ready at noon big room big and comfortable bed location is great as well however the hotel was quite difficult to find and we were not allowed to the swimming pool because our child is less than 16 this kind of information should be written jn hotel description because swimming pool was my priority while searching for the hotel  also we found blood stains on the blanket and tobacco remainings on the lamp so we guess that the room has not been properly cleaned after previous guests  it was good that there was a proper bath in the bathroom we really liked it but while showering all the water kept leaking to the floor because thewe had such a nice stay the services were great its very well located u can get anywhere from there the stuff were very helpful and made the stay even better over all it was a great stay i totally recomend itlovely stuff  mostly i liked the spa   its not very far from eiffel tower and other places you can visit the breakfest is very tasty and you have a lot of choises  it was a very pacefull vacantion excellent and polite staff good location of the hotel and very quiet area comfortable room and bathroom and very good breakfast the breakfast room is not so large however there is possibility to have breakfast in its own roomvery nice and clean hotel our room was very nice and cosy the view from the balcony was gorgeous staff  were always kind friendly and helped us out with every request also they have a beautiful spa i recommend this hotelhad a one night stay here on a business trip to paris a very impressive chic hotel with decor to match very comfortable room 102 with street view hotel is spotless for paris the room size was a pleasant surprise large double bed  plenty of room excellent shower that blows you away or wakes you up as needed very well appointed bedroom with complimentary water a chiller in wardrobe  allthe facilities you will need breakfast provided a very good range of continental offerings along with some hot food selections staff were very friendly polite  helpful the hotel has a small bar  a lrager area to relax in it is an honesty bar one helps themselves  then complete a form as to what drinks are taken this is then added to your bill while i appreciate it is out ofthe staff were very helpful and friendly it was very clean breakfast was traditional parisian style small and intimate hotel always clean not in the hustle and bustle of main paris but only a 5 minute drive to the eiffel tower selection of room service food was disappointing however uber eats is great so its a win win bar open 24 7 so cold drinks round the clock is a win win also local grocery shop around the corner for small snacks was sad to leave definitely recommend thanks for making my first time trip to paris a nice experiencewe decided to choose the felicien hotel for its location however pictures on their website look better than reality room is small and we were at level 3 ruby all red you have to be ready with the color bathroom is not functional very dark  you cant do a proper makeup room  bathroom were clean staff at the reception is professional and nice i cannot say i had a bad experience i think it is nice for one or 2 night but not a full stay in parisstayed here a couple of times the staff is friendly and helpful the hotel is clean and baths modern tubs are a bit deep for people with mobility problems i sprained my ankle while in paris breakfast is only ok better to just grab something at a nearby bakery the location is good because its close to 4 or 5 metro stops but it is a little out of the way for people that feel less comfortable taking public transitbeware warning this hotel makes you sign a form for  police  and no other hotel in paris has ever made this request  this hotel is in the 16th nice quiet neighborhood   the first impression will ruin your stay we actually called police and they had no idea what we are talking aboutme and my friend went for the spa it was really nice clean have all the utilities needed  and it was very comfortable also the stuff where very friendly it wont be the last time we would go therefrom the moment of arrival we loved it matteo on the desk checked us in seamlessly he advised us where to eat locally and could not do enough for us later he informed me he was intraining which added to the experience because he was an utmost professional throughout he is already a great asset to your chain we also met paloma who is another great asset to you overall a really lovely stay thank youmy husband and i had a 3 nights stay at the hotel felicien in france the hotel is nicely tucked in a very beautiful residential area nice continental breakfast in the morning clean hotel some of the decorations were a bit loud but was fixed with a room change the

needs to master better  some of the basic skills such as calling taxis and ensuring that baths drain properly 20 minute walk from the eiffel tower and very close to plenty of restaurants and cafes great place to visit it is a place where technology is open for all.

astotel had the friendliest staff that made you feel like you were walking into your own apartment back home shoutout to the gentleman with glasses at the front desk for greeting us every morning with a smile and helping us with how to get around the city you have two metro stations within walking distance to take you pretty much anywhere you want to go in paris staying at a luxurious hotel does not give you the true feeling of what its like to be in paris and experience the life of its localshotel was perfect  clean friendly close to great restaurants  location is perfect if you want to feel local but close enough to walk to the louvre in less than 30 minutes or metro if your lazy  all staff were helpful without exception  would definitely rebook when i return  paris was a break i really needed and throughly enjoyedthis hotel gives you everything you need after a busy day of sight seeing from moment you set foot inside this hotel you feel welcome up until the day you leave   the room was very clean and fitted with comfortable beds the fact that you can take a cold drink out of the included free off charge minibar is a real nice feature after a long day of exploring paris and its beautiful tourist attractions   we also made use of the breakfast in my opinion the breakfast serves everyones needs and is very versatile    so all these thing and the fact that the staff was very helpful and kind lets us believe this hotel is an absolute great choicei travelled to paris solo this was my first time doing a european trip the hotel staff made my trip a success they were super accommodating the day staff are the best  not to mention the hotel was next to everything nightlife popular barsrestaurants train station and busesi also did a tour with was organized by the staff i asked soooooooo many questions and they answered everything did i say i love the hotel its very whimsical which goes great with my goofy personality lol i would advice any female traveling solo to paris to come to this area and this hotelwe stayed in a twin room for 2 nights whilst attending the horse racing at longchamp the hotel was very clean and the staff were friendly and helpful free wi fi was speedy and an added bonus was the complimentary tea coffeewater and soft drinks that were available in the room and in the reception area also available in reception for free were a selection of cakes and biscuits to have with your teas and coffees the hotel was just 2 minutes walk from st georges metro  line 4 and a 5 minute walk from pigalle metro with the moulin rouge and sacre couer

in the vicinity of the hotel there are many excellent chef restaurants in addition the rooms are clean and nice having free minibar services both in the rooms and in the lobby the only downside is that until 100 at night there is noise from the street and also around 700 in the morning there is noise and there is no air conditioner on cooling there is only in summer so must open the window and so the noise sounds louderi had a very comfortable stay and good night sleep which was very important for my business trip the area of the hotel was very convenient with lots of diverse restaurants

amazing  one entire wall was covered in what i guess you would call a fresco  printed on some kind of plastic and completely blew us away  the lighting was amazing too  what looked like industrial lights fixed to the ceiling which you could move around on long arms  then there was the shower  glossy black tiles with leds embedded in them and a rain shower head the size of a small table to die

centrally and is walking distance to most sights 1520 minutes and the eiffel tower would be about 30 minutes  my only knock is that the rooms are extremely small wifi is terrible as a traveler this makes a huge difference and theres no room service or in house kitchenmy husband and i did a last minute booking at hotel georgette after having trouble with a reservation at another hotel  and we are so glad that we booked this place  the reception staff was genuinely professional and courteous  to our surprise and for no reason at all the day after checkin when we returned from a long day of touring paris we had a complimentary champagne bottle in our room with a very nice welcoming card pleasing smooth champagne too more importantly the room was clean  modern and it had a very comfortable bed its true that the space is cozy but everything is placed just right for convenience  the bathroom was spacious and modern great shower  the location cannot be beat and the hotel is

standards but common for paris  despite the size however the room feels comfortable  the location is in a great area with lots of great bakeries and restaurants nearby  a very positive experiencethe rooms we clean and the bed comfortable  the desk was too small in my room to adequately work it they offered seating in the lobby which was acceptable breakfast left something to be desired if one

Hotel Grand Powers,my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed our four night stay at the hotel grand powers  the hotel occupies a beautiful building and is just steps from the champs elysees and within walking distance of the eiffel tower  our room was chicly designed spacious and had a nice view over the cityscape below   most notable was the unfailing helpfulness and professionalism of each member of the hotels staff  they answered our requests immediately and were particularly informative and reassuring about current covid requirements in paris  i would unhesitatingly recommend this hotel to family and friendsi usually stay round the corner at four seasons george v but over last few years their prices have increased so much i wanted to look for an alternative  this hotel is second to none   location fantastic had a balcony room with view of the tower the bed is so comfy room was large and good value for paris ordered breakfast in bed absolutely perfectgrand powers is an absolute must stay this beautiful hotel and its amazing staff will become my family and friends mainstay in paris going forward i can not find one thing negative to mention thomas and his staff are amazingly accommodating and are wonderful people we usually stay at another 5star well known hotel nearby which is great as well but grand powers really out did them and has earned our loyaltycompletely lovely hotel experience  we loved our stay  a true five star experience and we felt completely pampered from the beautiful balcony view gorgeous bathroom to the service  we thoroughly enjoyed our staywas a great experience  nice atmosphere modern and victorian interiors  good location  clean and spacious rooms friendly and grateful receptionist  this hotel will be certainly my choice for next visiti recently stayed at hotel grand powers for 5 nights and i cannot wait to return the hotel is beautiful and my room was the nicest ive ever stayed in paris with a balcony and a view of the eiffel tower and the spa amenities were very relaxing the staff was so kind and welcoming especially the concierges they made me feel special every day the location was central to everything  i walked everywhere i cannot recommend the hotel enough  i will be sure to stay here again next time i visit mercii lived every single moment while staying at the grand powers starting wonderful and fast check in with complimentary champagne the room was exactly like i imagine typical luxurious parisian  apartment  modernart deco design with classic  empire  french spirit  definitely  the best boutique hotel in the most luxurious neighborhood of paris  cant wait to come back ps ask for 5th floor for the best viewi hate to write this review i stopped reviewing in ta a few years ago in protest  as it provided no incentive to continue unfortunately the entire experience here was so exceptional it would be unjust not to give credit for the exceptional service and experience we had there from the moment we entered the staff welcomed us by name  if we had a request it was addressed immediately without hesitation the room was spacious charming and immaculate with the view of the eiffel tower as promised the location is wonderfully adorned with the best shopping brands in the world good restaurants and sites paris is famous for a wonderful complimentary bottle of wine was brought to  our room for no reason  and greatly appreciated i cant say enough of the outstanding entirethe hotel is very well situated just near champselysees and metro stations upon arrival i was told that i was upgraded to junior suite i booked a deluxe room which was a very pleasant surprise the room was beautiful and clean the street in front of the hotel is a bit noisy which can be disturbing for a sensitive ear i always travel with my ear plugs so it wasnt a problem for me to sleep  the staff both at the front desk and at the restaurant are very friendly and it was a pleasure talking with them  i also had breakfast and lunch at the hotel and everything was fresh and delicious you can also have almond  oat milk for coffee and glutenfree bread which is great as this isnt an option in many places all in one i will definitely return to this hotel for mymy wife and i were very pleased with our stay at the hotel grand powers we have stayed at numerous hotels during our visits to the city and we agree that enjoyed our experience at the hotel the best thus far the comfort and the beauty of the room were great but it was the attention professionalism and courtesy of the staff that made it an exceptional experience for usi spent a lot of time researching hotels in paris and after switching from fauchon last minute i made the change to grand power purely for its location and reviews  ill start by saying im very glad i chose this hotel and it is justifiably high on tripadvisor having been on a 3 week trip around france and in many larger luxury properties this smaller boutique hotel was a welcome change and offers a much more personal refined service that is more difficult to achieve in larger establishments  check in was very warm and welcoming i found gonzalo very charming and authentic and he remained so very helpful and attentive throughout my stay regularly checking up on me the room was slightly delayed at check in but gonzalo insisted on more welcome drinks for me and was veryexcellent hotel great staff rooms perfect they let us shower in extra room after arriving from usa and our room was not ready free champagne at desk great breakfast beds perfect perfect location steps from arc de triomphe concierge helpful id stay here againthis is the best hotel ive stayed in paris the hotel grand power is ideally situated in the hearth of paris the breakfast is

available to us on the menu used to order to our room we had no idea there was sliced meat cheese eggs cereal etc i think it would be nice tomaybe not for someone looking for a huge room but if you`re okay with a cozy room i honestly think this is one of the best hotels in paris very clean homely the staff are very easy to talk to and its location is really goodthe hotel is great rooms are nice and tidy and the hotel is based right next to 2 metro stations which allow access to explore the whole of paris staff were very friendly and fluent in english and even recommended some tourist attractions

complimentary afternoon tea where they offer coffeetea nonalcoholic drinks and some,we stayed for 5 days at the 123 sebastopol and it was a great experience from start to finish we liked the movie theme decor in the hotel and the room was also beautifully decorated. complimentary afternoon coffee tea snacks and fruit were very appreciated would stay here again and recommend others to do so as well they also have a gym and a movie theater downstairs.

Hotel Le Quartier Bercy Square Paris,hotel was nice there was a funny smell in the room but the staff were so helpful  friendly  offered to change the room immediately breakfast was nicebut only had bacon on one of the mornings  would have liked it every morningsome if the hotel does need updatingtouching up but was nice enoughwould definitely stay againlocation is very goodclose to the metro very pleasant check in staff we got a family suite very quiet it felt like a newly renovated room extremely cleanthere was a safety deposit box in the room we took express breakfast option convenient beautiful layout of the hotel lots of restaurants in the neighborhood also a grocery store across the street auchanits a small hotel in bercy area the room is small but very clean i had a little issue my first day because nobody did my room so rest of the days i havent any other trouble they have a nice bar in the ground floorwe have spent a beautiful week in this nice hotel located near the metro station of daumesnil or dugommierthe staff is very kind   the room was clean and quite spacious the furniture is modernrecommendedvery friendly service good breakfast and good location close to the metro but very small room with barely any space to move and no parking space but in general i wouldnt recommend you to travel to paris in a cara clean comfortable hotel with reasonable room rates and pleasant helpful english speaking staff   daumesnil metro station just around the corner and a short ride takes you into the heart of paris and all the major tourist attractions   i had a nice double room spacious for a solo traveler   however there were cigarette burns in the curtains and part of the skirting board had been damaged roughly repaired but not repainted   also the shower head dripped constantly and loudly  i did report the shower head problem to reception but it was still dripping when i checked outthese are minor criticisms but they should be addressed as first impressions are very important to guests  however i no hesitation in recommending hotel lequartier and would certainly stay there againthe hotel was a comfy and nice place to stay where the staff was nice and willing to help the room was small and comfortable everything you need is nearby like metros a supermarket and nice cafesvery kind and helpful staff authentic neighbourhood market in the boulevard de reuilly several nice little restaurants dont miss the libanese one beyit jedo in the boulevard daumesnil we liked it all very muchi rarely complain about the hotels in which i stay unfortunatly this time its impossible the room was cleaned and nice but the bathroom continuously awashed a lot creating difficulties also the moquette in the room got wet and we hadnt bathfoam in the shower only a soap nothing more i selected two single beds choising the hotel because there was this possibility and there were only matrimonial solutions no one advised me before arrival or tried to help me in this request nor for the bathroom problems the situation was absolutly discomfortablegreat trip hotel room was not large enough for two and the lounge bar was a few seats with the reception having to be asked to serve a drink they seemed put oput so that was uncomfortable it was easier to find a local bar for a night capmy gf and i had a very pleasant stay in this hotel the room was very clean and the hotel staff was very helpful the wifi was okay and we slept very good qualityprice wise it is the best hotel i have ever had and there wasnt one grain of dust in the room fantasticgood hotel decent shower and location plus got an upgraded room so cant complain   not far from subway train and bus stations so easy to get around from the hotel   english speaking reception staff when i arrivedvery close to the metro you can enjoy your visit starting your tour from dugommier metro young and professional staff very good breakfast with croissant fresh fruit pancakes and a nice coffee i recommend it totallythis was my first time staying here and it was a great experience i will definitely stay here again the staff is very attentive and polite and breakfast was great the hotel is close to the metro station and there are a lot of restaurants and shops to choose fromstayed here for two nights at the end of january had decided to go to france for a couple of days so i wouldnt have to see in brexit from the uk  reception staff were really friendly and helpful and spoke good english particularly the male receptionist who offered to help me with my luggage when i mentioned i would prefer using the stairs rather than the lift to reach my room    my room was clean and tidy and bed was really comfortable there were teacoffee making facilities in the room and a good selection of channels on the tv  good choice of food for breakfast too mixture of cereals toast croissants fruit and some cooked stuff plus a selection of hot and cold drinks  only downside was the fact there were no traditional tea bags in the room so had to make do withit is very clean and the service is very good i think the bedroom is a little bit small for 2 persons but the breakfast is really nice at night you can stay in the lobby until am they should offer some snacks but in general i like everythinggreat hotel the staff were so friendly  helpful also the bed was so comfy great night sleep so relaxing  location was perfect the village is also great to visit i will be coming back to this hotel for suregood clean rooms and good size bathrooms very good breakfast except that one day the coffee machine broke downnand we were left in the dry small rooms but thisnis typical of whererver you chevkin innparis good connectivity and next to a metro station with direct metro line access to eiffel towerwe had a very nice trip  very friendly people and top service  there is nothing to fault about the breakfast  the pancakes were super tasty  the hotel is also perfectly located very nice restaurants around the hotel the rooms are not that big but everything is thereback same hotel after 10  years again i stay for the third time love the location and staff easy connection you can walk to metro station in less than 3 minutes the you can connect any in paris or air port or train to any euro countryfriendly and comfortable stay in a cosy room with temperature control away from the main road tea and coffee provided in the room bilingual staff made me feel welcome great price 5 mins walk from bercy station will come back againat the check in time  the front desk personell was not kind and helpfull he gave us an ipad and ask to fullfill the form but the form was french and i dont know french he did not help us after the form he demanded whole payment and city taxes in advance therefore my first experience with your hotel was negative unfortunately however at the check out time the front desk was helpfull and kind she achieved to change my negative opinionsgood location with local atmoshere like local food market people signing on the street very close to two metro stations very polite and usefull hotel and service teams very good breakfest local restaurants with french foods including oystersvery friendly service good breakfast and good location close to the metro but very small room with barely any space to move and no parking space but in general i wouldnt recommend you to travel

the street very close to two metro stations very polite and usefull hotel and service teams very good breakfest local restaurants with french foods including oystersi booked a room in this hotel thru a very famous online operator their classic room was not enough for us so we decided to go for their comfort room with breakfast included they are showing wrong photos on their listing for the comfort room so i was tricked to expect a larger and comfortable room i reported this to the booking website and to the property itself after a week the wrong photo has not been removed i start thinking is not honest mistake their classic and comfort room are very small the only difference is 1 useless square meter there is no space to move the cleaning staff didnt respect the dnd sign and argued with us to clean the room why tomorrow  we had to struggle to get 2 key cards for the room because we dont have so many ac was noti really enjoyed my stay even though i stayed only one night i was in one of the suites which consists in a living room bedroom bathroom and separate toilet overall the room was very clean looked new and comfortable a few details could be improved to high standard the bath curtain was not functioning properly the sliding door between living room and bedroom was not functioning properly there were plastic glass in bathroom it should be replaced with normal glass to reduce plastic consumption same for coffeetea would be better to have a normal cup the trend is to be more green but i didnt feel that trend the entrance door opens with a key  i think it would be easier and feel more modern to have a card key to open doors too  but again dont get me wrong this is,i rarely complain about the hotels in which i stay unfortunatly this time its impossible the room was cleaned and nice but the bathroom continuously awashed a lot creating difficulties. i selected two single beds choising the hotel because there was this possibility and there were only matrimonial solutions. hotel room not large enough for two and the lounge bar was a few seats with the reception having to be asked to serve a drink.
Hotel Le Royal,my daughter and i visited paris for the first time a few weeks ago and stayed at le royal  we arrived before checkin time and was informed our room was ready for us yay  staff was super nice and helpful with our questions  room was great no complaints whatsoever  breakfast was also good great way to start the day  location made it great to get around  would definitely stay there

explore paris without the noise of the metrothe best part of the hotel was the front desk staff who were helpful and accommodating with recommendations and arrangements thank you to evanah apologies for spelling for recommending a nearby bio local bistro and working with me on reservations the hotel is clean and tidy but as other travelers noted the standard rooms are tiny really beyond small even for paris or new york city standards ours could be described as a postage stamp even though it was well enough appointed consider an upgraded room if you will spend any time at the hotel breakfast was fine and fresh and included all of the basics the travelers were a mix of couples business and families it was very quiet as well at first i was not thrilled with the location of the hotel in montparnasse relative toair conditioned super tiny room nicely decorated no place to put suitcase or clothes no dresser no fridge no coffeemaker free tea coffee lattes in the nice lounge since drinks are not allowed in your room in case you spill something on the carpet i was told nice cold breakfastonly hot items were boiled and scrambled eggs which i cannot eat nice staff safe area no pool no stores on that street but more down the road towards the metro very near the catacombs taxis were cheaper than toronto canadabreakfast usually 13 euros but ours was included with our air transat package of 5 nights in both paris and then nicewe enjoyed our stay at this hotel it is in a good location with many cafes restaurants and stores nearby the room was very clean and the windows cut out the street noise  our first room was very warm the first two nights and we didnt think the air conditioning was working very well the staff at the front desk were so nice to let us switch rooms to one that was much cooler all of the staff were very helpful and friendly   i loved the fact that they had a nespresso machine in the reception area for a quick cup of coffee before going out

fantastic breakfast each morning it is within walking distance of many restaurants shops trains and buses the hosts were very helpful and friendlywe arrived at the hotel and received a very nice welcome we received a room upgrade which was very appreciated the room was clean modern and had enough space the only negative comment would be regarding the cleaning staff our room was located right next to their cleaning office on the 6th floor which got very noisy in the morning even though we understand they have a job to do it is not necessary to scream to one another while working they woke us up both mornings other than that the hotel was lovely and their lobby is very nice as wellin paris for theee days hotel is very well kept front desk staff was very courteous and helpful location is

delivers its not top top end but everything is good functional works well good quality beds decent bathrooms even of surprisingly decent size for the center of paris i often stay in that area and this is one of 3 hotels i keep coming back to depending on priceavailabilityfirst off they really took care of us at this property we had the junior suite and the room was roomy plush and perfect for 2 it included a fantastic view of the city so you felt like you were a true parisian  you are also in walking distance from of some of the most amazing boulageries and cafes that one could desire the metro is also in walking distance too and your about 20 to 30 minutes from major landmarks like the louvre and the eiffel tower the hotel staff is bilingual super helpful professional and really made us feel right at home anyone who has given this hotel a negative review should have their review privileges taken away nuff said i look forward to returning soonwe just returned from a wonderful three day visit to paris we travelled as a family of four teenagers ages 16 and 20 and stayed in the junior suite  the room was very nice and spacious by european standards  we had two twins that formed a king with additional twins in two other spots in the room  there was still plenty of room to walk around as well as a chair minibar with tv on it and a spacious closet with a safe the bathroom had double sinks a tub and separate shower as well as the toilet being in a separate spot with a door  we were barely in our room but it was nice to feel we had a little space when we returned each night  the room was spotless and was cleaned each day this hotel was in a residential area but had two metro stops very close by  we noticedvery comfortable hotel conveniently located close to vavin metro station just off bvd montparnasse we managed train metro  rer to cdg airport in about 80 minutes from the hotel despite main road rooms are quiet even on lower floors staff helpful and front desk open 24 hours probably better than its 3 star rating implies  breakfast is extra and fairly limited but no more so than usual in such hotels in paris room was well serviced and had pretty well all you could ask forexcellent staff very gracious and always helpful whenever asked excellent location  close to metro fine restaurants very close  including parc aux cerfsmy facorite bistro du dome le select and la coupolestayed as a family of 3 for 3 nights and we were really happy with this hotel we had stayed as a couple many years ago and werent sure how the hotel would be for 3 given room sizes in paris can be small however we had a lovely family room on the 3rd floor with ample space well laid out and not exposed to traffic noise it served as an excellent base to central paris with the option of various train stations in easy walking distance also an easy journey tofrom charles de gaulle away from the tourist bustle of the centre but close to montparnasse tower jardin de luxembourg shops and restaurants breakfast wasnt great but hey this is paris pleasant and helpful at concierge hopefully will stay again thanksvisited in december and pardon for the late reviewthis was one of the nicest hotels we stayedi was apprehensive since ive heard the french are very snobbish and rude to non speaking french customers but here all the staff speak english and smiling and politeeven the cleaning lady or the staff in the kitchen were exceptionally polite and friendlyi felt at home  especially being a foreigner the breakfast was very generous they have a breakfast buffet and it was really delicious and healthythey literally had anything you could have wanted on a breakfast menuthe rooms were very clean bathrooms again clean and the reception lady was very nice and helpful when we ask for guide or suggestionsalso location is excellent since its walking distance to the metronot the mentionthis hotel was perfect for our mother daughter spring break trip to paris it was not our first time to paris but first time at this hotel  it is in a perfect location for food and shopping we walked everywhere for hours and hours  it is also close to many metro stations so

restaurants shopping and atm machines all within walking distance le royal offers a delicious breakfast with cheerful staff the ladies at the front desk leticia and ann were so accommodating and gracious we had an incident with lost baggage at the airport and leticia was so helpful she helped my friend navigate the internet as well as the forms that were needed in order to retrieve her missing bag she was kind enough to get my friend an uber to the airport and help her navigate the metro back to the hotel leticia also gave wonderful suggestions for various restaurantswe had a superior room on the 1st floor which was spaciousand comfortable with a desk and chairs there was no noise despite facing the main road there was a separate bathroom and toilet with an excellent bath and shower there was plenty of choice at breakfast which was rapidly replenished in a light and airy room the receptionists were very pleasant and smiling the only minor quibble was that the safe was too high in our room and i had to stand on a chair to access properly  but overall again a fantastic staymy husband and i stayed at le royal hotel in january 2019 and had a fabulous time  the hotel is in a perfect location close to metro stations within walking distance to many historical landmarks and close proximity to delicious restaurants  we had a deluxe room which was comfortable clean and

by the family room i had booked which was large enough for all 3 of us to feel at home and comfortable  hotel left bank has it all  effective air conditioning in a city where that is not always the case comfortable bedsa  large and impeccably clean bathroom a vintage french feel  it is great value for the money and a lovely experiencewe decided to stay here given the good reviews it has on tripadvisor  the location is outstanding and so if that is the key consideration then this hotel is for you otherwise the decor of the hotel is dated our room had a stale smell to it the breakfast very average and the service nothing notable  one bonus is a wonder boulangerie across the road that is perfect for breakfastjust got back and wanted to write a review we were in paris with my sisters family we stayed at this hotel while they stayed on the champs elysses at a 900 a night hotel after visiting them at their hotel all i could think of was how much i liked our hotel better their hotel

baguettes and the many breakfast offerings location was central and accessible will be staying here again on my future trips to paristhis hotel was everything we expected a paris hotel to be  full of charm comfortable and great location for getting around close to 2 metro stops we had the breakfast deal added and im glad we did as it was a nice way to start the day the room itself was very pretty and the fixtures and furnishings were of a high standard we stayed in the delux triple room and it was perfect for the 3 of us 2 adults and a child we were there during a severe heatwave but the rooms airconditioning coped without any problems at all and we remained cool and comfortable the hotel was surrounded by eating options  recommendthis beautiful hotel is reasonably priced has a great location and excellent staff i enjoyed our stay and would stay there again we had easy access to wonderful restaurants shops and a taxi to assist us in getting around paristhis hotel was our base in paris for 5 nights before getting on our river cuise we wanted something safe clean and  close to the metrothe left bank was all of these the rooms were spacious and the beds comforting after long days of touring the breakfasts started our days off right with great coffee and items served on china dishesthe guys at the front desk shared wonderful places for dinner and made prearrival reservations for places we wanted to visit this was a great choice when we come back to paris this is where we will stayfriends recommended the hotel left bank  and we are grateful they did location is amazing 5 minute walk to the metro and rer  we only had 1 bag each so the rer train was an easy ride to cdg easy walk to the highlights of the city such as luxembourg gardens musee dorsay louvre the area has restaurants from street food to high end just fun walking around  the breakfast was perfect for us croissants cheeses meats fruit yogurt and fresh made eggs at a small charge breakfast was served until 11am we initially had a small but adequate room but fannie upgraded us to room 604 which was a real treat spacious beautiful views and comfort beyond our expectations  fannie and christophe went out of their way to provide information and advice we had a wonderful 6 dayslocated in a great area where we could walk to everything street and cafe life just around the corner staff were very professional friendly and helpful booked direct and were kindly given an upgrade to a deluxe twin which was huge room at the rear of the building overlooking an internal courtyardthis possibly made the wifi patchy but quiet for a good nights sleep this was a character filled room with french furnishings fabrics and wooden beams marble bathroom and separate toilet we took advantage of the 5 euro continental breakfast which was good value and set us up for our days of strolling through beautiful parisi stayed there for two days in the middle of october and it was a perfect stay   the hotel seems to be full so dont count on checking in early but they can hold your luggage and there are nice places to eat and see nearby   i was traveling alone and was upgraded to a deluxe room it is on the lobby floor and i was skeptical that it would be loud but i surprisingly didnt hear much i kept the window open so the air inside the room wasnt so stuffy i always sleep with a soft white noise sound and i never awoke to any loud sounds or people   the room was spacious with a king bed and a day bed the bathroom had a separate shower and bath the bed only had two pillows which i could foresee being a problem for other travelers but i bet it wouldnt be a big deal to an extravery helpful people great location walk too all the great tourist sites rooms clean small not am america hotel french hotel breakfast in cheap and good steady here before and found it most convincemy family stayed in the top floor suite of the hotel and we couldnt have been more happy with our accommodations

the location was perfect  just steps from a metro station and taxi stand  less than a mile walk to the louvre  many food options nearby  we felt very safe in the neighborhood and enjoyed every bit of our stay  i was beyond thrilled to be able to see the eiffel tower from one side of our room and notre dame or what remains at this time from the other side  i would not hesitate to stay here againthis charming hotel is in the perfect location we only stayed one night but staff were super friendly and helpful our deluxe room was very large and the bathroom was huge it was on the first floor and only had a window into an outside natural area which was kind of odd this made the room very quiet and did let some fresh air in ive already booked another stay for the springmy name is

Hotel Longchamp Elysees,we stayed here for 3 nights at the end of august 19 location is 510 minutes walk from the eiffel towerand plenty of nice bars and restaurants yet the hotel itself is very quiet and relaxing after a long day of site seeing very pricey area though so be prepared to spend 100 on a meal in the evening for two hotel was a small compact boutique that offers bed and breakfast waking up to the smell of fresh croissant was a win friendly staff at reception room was very small however for a short city break for 2 this was just fine price was no different from 3 nights at a premier inn in the uk would recommendi highly recommend this hotel mr idris and all the staff were so helpful  extremely nice the room was very clean pretty the beds were very comfortable and the most important is the location youre going to be in the safest and most beautiful neighborhood in paris liliana mendozawe chose this hotel due to its excellent location  right next to the trocadero and short walks to the tour eiffel and arc de triomphe it is well positioned for a short city break  30mins from gard du nord on the metro  the facilities provided were good  clean room comfy bed ensuite  i was surprised though at what was not included in the room wifi is available but costs extra tea and coffee facilities are in reception not the room and again there is a charge there was a safe but no key provided  i assumed it similarly cost extra but may be wrong  so 35 because those things i would expect as standard were not provided without additional payment other than that it is a nice hotel in an excellent locationperfect location perfect friendly personal parking lot to reserve nearby good continental breakfast clean nice and good restaurant in neighborhood location also in very nice neighborhood tres bienthe hotel is near the trocadero place one of the best place to see the eiffel tower near the chaillot palace near also le muse des monuments franais le muse de la marine  its very well locatedwe came here quite a few time these last years and i we wont change for another hotel very nice staff clean hotel  rooms very cute and instagrammable patio perfect location as usual we booked for the dinner which is always amazing and tasty cant wait to come back and thanks to the teamwe were forced to cancel our trip due to the pandemic and hotel longchamp was the only accommodation that would not work with us on obtaining a refund or even letting us change our dates to one year later they did offer us to pay a change fee to change our dates a few months later but didnt offer this until less then one week before our planned stay which was too late to coordinate with the rest of our already rescheduled trip hotel longchamp had ignored all communication with us when trying to deal with this in a timely manner our experiences with all our other various flight and hotel reservations etc really worked with us to refund or move our dates to a later time that all syncs up all in the same trip for this reason i cannot recommend this hotel they find any reasoni highly recommend this hotel mr idris and all the staff were so helpful  extremely nice the room was very clean pretty the beds were very comfortable and the most important is the location youre going to be in the safest and most beautiful neighborhood in paris liliana mendozaperfect location perfect

hotel for 2 nights on holiday on arrival we left our bags as we were before the room was ready and on return our bags were put into our room and coats hung up in the wardrobe which was great the hotel room was a great size bathroom where toilet is a little small but great room and the beds so comfy we were able to add breakfast on the morning if we wanted when we woke up and the staff were really friendly as we didnt know paris very well the reception member got the map and identified all the main tourist attractions the two metro stations which the hotel is between and also gave us some great restaurants to visit which helped up a lot throughout the few days we stayed would highly recommend staying herewe came here quite a few time these last years and i we wont change for another hotel

a review since we are so happy with this hotel it really lived up to the expectations that we had it is just as fresh as in the pictures friendly staff and central location recommend itmy stay in the hotel was unforgettable the rooms are very private and clean the bathroom is very neat as well the staff was friendly and welcoming makes me feel like home is near to trocadero so you can go a enjoy the view of the beautiful eiffel towerclean rooms friendly staff really feels like home  breakfast is nice everything is fresh and delicious  reception is at your service 247 and that is great  one disadvantage  you can hear the noise in the hall while being in your roomi have chosen this hotel several times and will certainly stay there again it has an excellent location both for touristic and business trips the rooms are clean and comfortable the hotel staff is very attentive and helpfulhotel is in a great location staff was pleasant and helpful rooms are very tight standard double end bed was literally less than a foot from the wall no floor space to open your bags carpet in room and stairwell is kinda old dark and not clean looking stairwells seemed darkrecently stayed here with my family i have a young baby and was still made to feel welcome which has been a problem when travelling previously  great location nice clean hotel i would definitely recommendmy family stayed in a triple room 2 adults 1 child at this lovely little hotel and loved it  the location could not be beat it was a few minute walk to the metro and only a couple more to the eiffel tower the hotel staff was so kind and nice the breakfast each morning was very tasty and the room was a good size for our family when we return to paris we will definitely stay here againthe area was good for restaurants and close to metro station the problem came when they stated that the room was handicapped accessible not even the entry was accessible there were stairs and a smaller than average doorways the bathroom was very small and the toilet room was so small that not only the door would not open farther than 13 of the way but you had to straddle the toilet to close the door the biggest problem was that the room was too small i know that paris has small rooms but this was like a closet i am not exaggerating there was also construction so ask if there still is any as it was very loudvery nice staff shout out to edris and brightaquad room was nice 4 sistersfirst time in parisand clean location couldnt be betterwalking distance to the eiffel tower and other tourist spots easily accessible by bus or metrotrainhighly recommenced as we will surely stay here again next time we visit parislocation 1010 the administration 1010 we were absolutely happy in this hotel hope to come back here again and again  i dont know what else to say so im writing something to tripadviser   good bey see u soonmyself and my partner are a young couple who had a very pleasant experience on our visit to paris on easter weekend we experienced the wonderful paris friday traffic jams lol when we arrived we received a warm welcome from the lovely man at reception it was quick he gave us a map with all the locations and told us the nearest metro station stayed in room 504 was a nice room my only criticism is that control of the aircon should be done from the room as i had to ask the receptionist but that was no bother as we did this when left in the morning to then come back to a very cool room as the weather was amazing and very hot i certainly would recommend this hotel for its location and the cafes  restaurant are just amazing thank you hotel longchamp elyseesi first stayed here in 1984 and when it came time to visit again with my wife we did so this spring  the hotel is a small family affair where the front desk and other staff know you by name after the first night  it is close to two metro lines and within walking distance to the bois de bologne champs elysees eiffel tower trocodero museums and more and there are many good restaurants bistros chinese sushi portuguese patisseries the accommodations are first rate and the amenities are superior  looking forward to visiting again and soonmy husband and i stayed here for our ruby wedding anniversary and it is a fab hotel centrally situated near the eiffel tower and just a short walk from larc de triomphe metro station just a few minutes walk from hotel the staff here are so nice and really helpful we would highly recommend it to anyone travelling to paris bernie  patsywe had a great four night stay at hotel longchamp elysees the staff was very welcoming and willing to assist from the moment we arrived arriving on a saturday we had concerns about the protest but they immediately pulled out a map and explained areas we should avoid the rooms were on the smaller size  to be expected but were clean and well kept planning to be out for the majority of the day and returning late at night we were a little hesitant that we had to leave our hotel key at the desk but there was always someone there when we arrived back at night the location was great to easily travel by metro and the staff was more than willing to accommodate holding our luggage on our last day would certainly recommendnice hotel in paris france near the eiffel tower  great staff very helpful  room was small but comfortable and safe  no refrigerator in the room but europe doesnt usually provide refrigerators in rooms anyway  very small hotel but near many cafes metro and sightseeing  best hotel we stayed in during our tripi generally do not write poor reviews however i would not stay here again at all no lift to the room as you can see by the spiral staircase photos no offer of assistance to the room with baggage for my 70yr parents walls paper thin i could here kids yelling at all hours the ac is not controlled by you in your room the door key had to be left with front desk for the day its 2019 invest in proper doors locks the male at the front desk clerk was extremely rude  camille you were lovely and tried to make up but at some point you have to cut your losses  the food for breakfast what food eggs not cooked 2 baguettes small pieces of cheese a feeble pieces of ham etc disappointing decent location the eiffel tower was close and that is the best i can say for thislong champs elysees hotel is great exceeded my expectations few walks to restaurants grocery stores and to eiffel where it is great to see at night breakfast is great chooses are many hotel size is good bathroom is really spacious  hotel has mini english garden to smoke eat has concierge service that keeps your belongings safely hotel is clean  quiet   certainly will recommend to friends and family,we stayed here for 3 nights at the end of august 19 location is 510 minutes walk from the eiffel towerand plenty of nice bars and restaurants yet the hotel itself is very quiet and relaxing. wifi is available but costs extra tea and coffee facilities are in reception not the room and again there is a charge there was a safe but no key provided  i assumed it similarly cost extra but may be wrong  so 35 because those things i would expect as standard were not provided without additional payment.

the metro cafes the room had air conditioning and was very clean and had a wonderful parquet style wood floor rather than dated and worn carpet one of the best features they offer that even much more expensive hotels dont is s fridge with free drinks in your room as well as coffee and tea with real cups not paper as they do in the us the lobby was wonderful with snacks and drinks for free and they had a nice little outdoor courtyard you could sit in the staff wad very friendly and helpful though i did have a glitch with a grumpy one in the morning of my departure but overall it washands down the best hotel we had the pleasure to stay at and made our visit to paris that much more enjoyable  everything from the amazing staff room breakfast  lounge area to the quiet central location  a variety of great restaurants shops markets  pharmacies around the hotel  there was even a laundromat up the street which is a big help when traveling with kids  i was most impressed with the impeccable customer service  lucille had arranged our room to be available prior to normal check in time of which my daughters  i were so grateful for due our major jet lag  loved the night manager emilio and the rest of the staff helped us with the best recommendations  we cannot wait to come backfrom a comfortable room very friendly receptionists particularly the spanish guy who worked the night shifts didnt catch his name he took the time to make some recommendations very clean room with free drinks in the minibar restocked every day plus free use of umbrellas which was a life saver  highly recommend staying here hotel is comfortable and near barsrestaurantsmetro  breakfast as it should be   hint walk around neighbourhood is worth time you can find nice bar in any direction

soft drinks coffe and cake the location was good and very close to the subway i recomanded i really enjoyed my stay in hotel lorette the staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms were modern my favourite part was the location there was a lot of bars and restaurants nearby and a great atmosphere in an area that is not overly touristic while also being walking distance to montmartre opera and most of the places i enjoy visiting when i come to paris i would definitely stay here againthe staff of the hotel was absolutely amazing and kind u can eat and drink for free in the lounge you can also use this bonus in every hotel of the company room was perfect you have a lot of privacy your own bathroom everything was clean and ready when we arrived youll get some drinks and kettle too  location of the hotel is indescribable its not in the center but close to everything you can walk anywhere you want metro station was closeor you can just walk and kinda get lost in the streets there  and youll see how beautiful is whole city not just tourist monumentsi liked everything from the location to the reception kind staff to my beautiful and rather spacious room for paris to the comfort of the bed and the bathroom very clean and with a bathtub to the free drinks in the fridge and some sweets in the lobby all in all such a gem and such a good atmosphere i will be back ps also the tips of the staff for lunch drinks and the antigen test location pps there all kind of bars restaurants and little shops nearby where you can find everything and the metro is like 50 m awayfacilities were very good for the price point however what was more impressive was the customer service  the manager  front office team went over  beyond to investigate a booking error which was not their fault  helped me rearrange my stay ensuring i was not out of pocket   in spite of my nervousness at the potential outcome they remained calm  composed and reassuring and made sure the issue was resolved displaying exceptional professionalism throughout the processthis hotel was such a great find  my family and i just returned from quite a busy trip to paris and staying at hotel lorette made it a wonderful experience  we were impressed from the very beginning by the fantastic location right by the metro the courteous knowledgeable and super helpful staff snacks in the lobby and free water juice  tea in the room the tiny but lovely room itself the complementary umbrellas and the attention to cleanliness and comfort  the beds and linens were comfortable and the air conditioning was a

nearby  not too far from the city my partner is french said the area is not too good but ok for a short stay staff very helpful  my room was not ready when i arrived is a down side as all you want to do is relax and freshing up after a flight i had to wait a half a hour but i would recommend it for a short side note its not in the city its outside the city bus service nearby 15 min drive to city louve  not too far from all the paris lifemyself and my partner are hotel perfectionists if something isnt right we will always complain in order to amend our issues however there were zero faults with this hotel it delivered way more than expected in terms of cleanliness style and location rooms were bigger than expected i had previously set myself up for a bed with no floor space at all however it was spacious enough really quirky vibe  very friendly reception staff on our last day a gentleman with glasses was very attentive to us even after our checkout would highly recommend this hotel given its very affordable pricewe stayed there for 3 nights the room is good enough clean and well presented but the bathroom is really small and cumbersome women should take their hair dryer with them because theres not one but what really let me down is the breakfast its bad cheap not enough choices tastes bad too well its bad in every way i advise you to forget about taling the breakfast option because youll be better of eating that outside with the same brice but much betteri was fully prepared for a bit of a dump  having booked the cheapest place i could find in paris but i was pleasantly surprised small but clean comfortable bed good shower decent breakfast for the extra charge 24hour manned desk all of whom were really friendly and helpful  the location is great too grab a 90 bus right into the heart of paris loads of little eateries around and right across the road from a minimarket  highly recommended and i would absolutely stay there againnice clean modern

attendant mohammad was just awful my friends and i went out for a night out and had to go wait outside for 20 minutes because of a sleeping mohammad he came to the door with his shirt wrinkled and looking super sketchy and dishoveled i checked out and immediately noticed i left my passport with a bag of important documents in the safe i called mohammad and he not so convincingly told me the safe was closed and empty which was a complete lie the safe was open he hung up abruptly without giving me further information super sketchy and unfortunate because the day time attend imed was a nice guy thanks for ruining my paris tripwe stayed there for 3 nights the room is good enough clean and well presented but the bathroom is really small and cumbersome women should take their hair dryer

unfortunate because the day time attend imed was a nice guy thanks for ruining my paris tripthis was okay for a few nights the rooms are even smaller than london standard didnt think that was possible would not stay in this hotel again however the area was really great would stay there again for sureroom was tidy we both felt it small for a double room and was next to the main road you could hear the cars and sirens all night some staff at reception were helpful others not so next to the bus stops but a good 10min walk to the metro nothing to visit apart from cafes takeaway and electronic shops a basic understanding of french would be advisablei was surprised at how cheap the hotel was to stay in but for how much we paid it was great the bed linen and towels were changed every day it was very cleanquiet and both of us slept very well the hotel is in a good location a few minutes walk to joules joffrin metro which gives easy access to the centre the only downfall was that the room was small but thats paris and that we would have liked a kettle in the room so we could make our own teacoffeei stayed here for 2 nights on business the weather was extremely hot and the hotel rooms do not have air conditioning and even with the window open and the fan the temperature was almost unbearable for sleeping or working the room was small with basic facilities typical for paris breakfast was generally good and staff were mostly pleasant and helpful as other reviewers have said the area is rather unpleasant overall not bad but colleagues stayed in nicer hotels hotels for a similar budgetlovely hotel with very helpful staff the rooms are a bit small but thats to be expected in paris the location was excellent with many lovely restaurants nearby i would not hesitate in recommending this hoteli had a lovely stay at the hotel lumieres lovely district if montmatreit was very cosy modern and beautiful and cleanstaff were very efficient and nicei was able to have an inclusive breakfast with much choice to set me up for the day there was a coffee machine and snack machine which was very handy the price was reasonable toowe stayed here for two nights and found nothing to complain we only dealt with friendly and helpfull staff our room was a little bit small but nice it was well equiped and clean its a bit tricky to find the parking and to find your way out but its worth it the location is great busstop right in front 10 min walk to the next metrostation right next 2 supermarkets 2 min up the street a bistro a good italian restaurant and if you want to only 1015 min walk to sacre coeur we liked this hotel very much and recommed it strongly be aware in paris you want find a hotel under 10000 with 5 stars so when you want more you have to pay morewe stayed at the hotel lumieres for three nights it was very tiny which we expected the rooms were clean and tidy our sons room had a light switch missing and the tv remote didnt work but if you are english that wouldnt really matter anyway seeing as there were no english speaking channels available and our desk wouldnt stay up because the clip had broken but they werent things that would affect our stay too much we didnt have breakfast as at 10 per person we thought it quite steep for a croissant so went to the supermarket directly opposite and bought breakfast for four for 6 we thought we had chosen a pretty area of montmartre but actually it was anything but it was full of kebab shops and graffiti but if you walk 15 minutes up towards the sacre coeur you canwe stayed in the hotel for 5 days we found a very good deal on the website the room was very clean no road noise even if the room was facing the road good curtains made the room pitch black and had all the necessities that you might need during your stay  breakfast was very good with pastries jams nutella yogurts but also cheese ham and fruits  our stay was lovely good location with loads of places to visit nearby and bus stop and tube station very close we had an incredible value for the money but the best part of our stay was the staff i made a last minute reservation and i was in contact with a very polite gentleman that reassured me that everything was ok before our flight to paris everyone speaks english and that really saved us since we do not speak frenchthis hotel is lovely staff are very friendly and our room was extremely clean the hotel is in a good location to explore montmartre the hotel is situated very close to public transport taking you into the centre of paris we used the bus which dropped us right outside the louvre and was extremely cheap hotel room was a reasonable size for a city hotel one of the best ive stayed in the reception staff also booked us a shuttle back to the airport which was cheaper than a taxi would definitely recommend this hotela very pleasant 5 night stayroom 306 street facing roomroom was spotless  had all that you need for your staythe little soap bars  shower gel etc are quality productswe had no problems sleeping the bed was superwe opted to eat breakfast here every morning10 euro eachthis represented good value for money there is a small supermarket across from the hotel if you need anything from gar du nord station its around a 25 minute walk if you feel up to itwe chose to walk all the time during our stay  had no problems seeing all we came to see walking from the hotel every day thank you for a wonderful staygreat stay clean and comfortable with towels changed everyday and a helpful staff its a bit far from the city centre but the neighborhood is quite safe and quiet no reason to worry the underground and the busses let you reach all main attractions prices below paris average will recommend  just a tip if you want to have a cheap but huge breakfast just go to the patisserie round the corner its awesomeit was a visit of 5 days no elevator service for 2 days not so good breakfast very small room no airconditioning and the worst no changing the sheets which is very important however good staff close to bus stops and about 10 minutes from metro stations not a bad choose for a couple of medium income but it could be better i hope they improve their services because there is a lot of potential i am leaving a review of 2 stars due to the sheets i really believe its very important to change in a stay of more than 2 daysextremely pleasant and helpful staff comfortable small but immaculately clean rooms which cater for your needs when most of the time is spent sight seeing etc a good continental breakfast situated in montmartre close to sacre cur 10 minutes walk from the metro station and then 15 minutes to the centre many restaurants available locally for an evening meal including le chat des oliviers which was excellent we would definitely stay here againwe stayed at the hotel lumieres montmarte for 2 nights in early january being an annual trip to paris we decided to try and stay somewhere different the location was great only a 1015 walk from port de clignancourt metro station m4 and literally just around the corner from the bus31 stop there is a supermarket directly opposite as well as one 2 doors down there are also a number of pharmacies and tabac shops for any other immediate needs  the rooms were warm and cosy enough room for 2 people having stayed in paris a number of times i understand that you can quite often be pushed for space however the rooms offered plenty room for storing baggage and coats  meaning that there was plenty of open space the bathroom was sufficient with an overhead shower and avery handy for my family this hotel is close to montmarte staff were very friendly and helpful the room was very clean with lovely smooth sheets and an excellent mattress so slept very well good shower although small but i could not get the two shower heads to work individually and i have this set up at home so know how it works i told the receptionist but it wasnt fixed there is a small wardrobe with just a few hangers and no drawers just a shelf but thats fine for a few days i dont take breakfast so i liked the fact that this was extra as im not paying for something i dont have apart from the shower problem it was a really good stay and i would come back again oh and theres a supermarket right opposite and cafes and restaurants all aroundthe staff were very helpful especially george we did struggle with directions but that was our struggle  the hotel was in  neighborhood which we liked  wish we had visited the cool places in montmartre but ran out of timei stayed here with a friend whilst we visited paris for 4 days in august the hotel is located slightly out of the centre close sacre coeur and the metro station jules joffrin is a ten minute walk which will take you to all the main attractions   the hotel is nice and comfortable with all needed amenities and the staff are friendly and welcoming the rooms are small but as to be expected in paris and fine as a place to base yourself whilst visiting the sites of the city the shower is great and we had a large comfortable double bed   highly recommend as a base whilst visiting the city for a few daysmy family and i stayed for a night and in that stay we experienced beautiful clean rooms a delicious breakfast but most notably a warm and hospitable staff who went out of their way to call around for a specific dish we were wanting for dinner if given the chance we will definitely come back,stayed for 4 nights at lumieres monmartre and had a pleasant enjoyable experience staff are helpful and polite and speak english well  the rooms are modern very clean and cozy and there is minimal noise from the street outside the nearest metro station. The location is great too grab a 90 bus right into the heart of paris loads of little eateries around and right across the road from a minimarket.
Hotel Mademoiselle,nothing to complain very nice staff small but very pleasant rooms with a very good breakfast is in short walking distance to the gare de lest and gare du nord in a nice little street i would love to stay there againthis is the second time we stayed in this hotel and we were again very satisfied location and service are very good from the gare de lest you can easily walk to the hotel  as last time we had a room to the inner court that was very calmgreat place to visit paris clean romantic rooms amazing staff good breakfastbuffet love this place 5stars this hotel is close to gare du nord train and metro on walking distance a lot of restaurants surrounding the hotel even a great market with oysters and wines a supermarket next to the hotelwithin walking distance of the gare du nord in a road appropriately called the street of small hotels the hotel frontage is very small  so is the rest of it  tall and narrow built around a small courtyard rooms are small but well equipped and the breakfast buffet is  by french standards at least  quite reasonable scrambled eggs bacon and sausage very helpful staff at receptioni spent three nights in this well located hotel  the team was warm and really helpful also sanitizer and masks are available for customers  the room was of decent size for a hotel downtown top notch quality matress  i highly recommend this hotelstylish and warm boutique hotel just 5 minute walk away from gare du nord and gare de lest   rooms were nice and we had a nice view on the parisian style buildings on the other side of the street   from the hotel you can easily walk to the le marais neighbourhood and canal st martin which are both very nice areas   breakfast was not very special and it took a long time before we got served but i guess this is due to corona and that in normal times there is a buffet where you can help yourself  i did not use the spa so cannot comment on that  will be backgreat little hotel walking dinstance from gare du nord and the lovely street in the 9th arrondissement small but very clean rooms with good beds very friendly and professional staff we had a great staywe only had one night in paris and needed to hit the sights prior to our check in time and the reception staff at the hotel were very friendly and allowed us to store our case until we came back to the hotel later that evening we also had use of the comfortable lounge after our check out time and prior to our departure on the eurostar the following evening  a very nice stylish hotel conveniently situated we would definitely stay again if we came back to pariswe stayed here a few years back  returnded as it left such a geat memory for us  amazing stay made special by the staff here it may be a bit too central for some but we love that and the vibrancy that comes with it this hotel is almost exactly halfway between gare d est and gare d nord excuse spelling  there is a food store three doors down  the breakfast buffet was delicious and very filling   the staff was very helpful answering some local travel questions  t was able to reserve a room at a very large discount  not sure how long these will last as travelers

details the hotel is quiet which is a miracle considering its right in the centre of the city you practically fall out of gare du nord and into the hotel it has a big atrium where you can have breakfast the breakfast itself was a dream for someone who loves croissants and pain au chocolat on top of that the room was well acd and dont even get me started on the good water pressure i got in the shower its the perfect place for a trip to pariseverything in this hotel is superb value for money cleanliness  the staff could not be more helpful  everybody was excellent but a special thank you

amazing stay made special by the staff here it may be a bit too central for some but we love that and the vibrancy that comes with it this was my first visit to france let alone paris and i definitely picked the right hotel within easy walking distance from gare du nord we found the hotel in a back street location which left a bit to be desired the frontage looks a little run down which concerned me but as soon as you walk through the front door youre in a clean well presented reception area with an extremely well presented polite efficient humorous english speaking receptionist i understand that not all reception staff speak as good english as the young man we encountered all the staff we encountered were exceptionally polite and couldnt do enough to make our stay enjoyable in fact id go as far to say that they were more than happy to go out of their way for their guests our room 307 waswe stayed for 3 nights room was large enough with a really big comfortable double bed bathroom and shower not walkin was sizeable the staff all of them are excellent nothing is too much the two restaurant recommendations nearby were both superb  you are located around 10 mins slow walk from gare du nord so perfect for eurostar or airport with rer connection there is a food market less than a minutes walk away  the breakfast is wide ranging lots of choice dont think they have evening restaurant option but they will put out a lovely meats  cheese  salmon platter on request delicious after a good days sight seeing their small bar area is a cosy place to have a couple of drinks before retiring for the evening they advertise a spa but we did not use sohad a short stay at this hotel its clean and comfortable located close to gard de nord and gard de est beaning getting the metro is convenient   access to the gym was disappointing as they whole gym was booked for classes  also no weights machines  breakfast options were good and athe staff were very politei have rarely come across a boutique hotel as friendly and caring at the same time they take away all of your cares and worries in the world and help to make your stay with them better than you ever imagined   the staff is not a staff they are a familya lovely hotel great location for our visit superb service throughout especially upon check in and check out very good value for money clean throughout and good wifi i highly recommend this hotelwe will be back when we need a hotel in paris for a short business trip business partner was convinced as well next time we will try the breakfast so cant comment on that  clean room bathroom maybe a little too smallwe typically stay at homeawayaitbnb type places but we thought wed give a hotel a try during our second paris trip we are so glad we did the staff was beyond accommodating typically i get names and i neglected to do so every interaction we had with staff was really pleasantentertaining   we checked in the morning of 112020 our room wasnt ready and the front desk person offered to store our luggage until our room was ready within minutes he found us a room without our asking which was an upgrade at no additional charge he had a dry sense of humor that my wife and i found entertaining and thought he was very personable as we waiting for the elevator we heard a crash noise from inside the elevator shaft and the elevator stopped afraid someone may havegreat for being able to walk with luggage to and from eurostar at gare du nord  extremely helpful staff able to leave bags and collect for departure later than time of vacating the room  excellent breakfast for france  very comfortable bed next to the local market for the arondisment which is worth a visit  perhaps a little aspirationally priced but this is paris for youwe were looking for a boutique hotel close to gare du nord for a trip from charles de gaulle we found hotel mademoiselle with tripadvisors help so glad we did  excellent location walking distance from train and underground front staff excellent and rooms clean and sparkling excellent highly recommendstayed here for 2 nights and chose it as it close to the eurostar terminal but on a quiet street feels like a world away from it  location was great lovely locals food market less than a minute away hotel was clean and funky with a cute little bar room was clean and i was lucky enough to be upgraded to a larger room for my stay staff were really friendly and accommodating  basically there wasnt a single thing i could fault  would definitely go backconveniently situated right next to gare du nord near the first day lunch placebrasserie flodere and easy to get elsewhere just lovely helpful staff which makes all the difference  nothing too much trouble and super friendly also great breakfast,great place to visit paris clean romantic rooms amazing staff good breakfastbuffet love this place 5stars this hotel is close to gare du nord train and metro on walking distance a lot of

Hotel Madison,i had a lovely stay at the madison the hotel is perfectly located in the heart of the 6th arrondissement so walking distance to just about everything the hotel room is clean and the windows open wide to the beautiful avenue below we loved the shower and the water pressure was perfect we did not have breakfast ast the 17 euro price tag is a bit high especially when you have a paul right down the street  the only place where improvement could be made is recognizing people who are staying multiple nights and unfortunately there are some homeless  men who hang out outside which is a delicate situation for sure all in all i would definitely return to the madisonwe loved this hotel  we chose it because it looked nice and was right next to the st germain  metro location  room was great however we chose a larger room which i recommend because most paris hotel rooms are small  there is a very nice sitting bar area near the lobby and the breakfast was lovely  i highly recommend for the location and warmth of this property  it wil be our new regular hotel in paris  well donethis hotel was amazing the staff was outstanding in all ways anything we needed they were there to assist the room was beautiful excellent taste in their decor it was very difficult leaving almost like leaving family the location was prime we cant wait to return hopefully next year cant say enough about this placemy husband and i loved our 4night stay at htel madison  we got a warm welcome by arthur when we arrived that already made us feel at home this is the first time bringing our baby dog to paris and the hotel is really petfriendly  decoration of the hotel is very nice and cozy breakfast was very good cleanliness excellent and location is more than perfect close to lots of restaurants shops and in front of the saint germaine des pr church neighborhood very pleasant for a walk and 15 minutes from the jardin du luxembourg but what really makes the difference in the hotel is its lovely staff that are always willing to go above and beyond to make us feel special arthur sanjay the night receptionist the breakfast team and all the support associates of the hotel arewe booked for 3 nights in paris and ended up extending our stay because we had such a lovely time our room was spacious and we had a quintessentially parisien view out of our window of a lovely church the location

now on we enjoyed the st germain area great location and restaurants a mustmy goto hotel in paris is closed until september 2021 owing to covid so my online search for a good hotel in the st germain area led me to the madison i was impressed by the number of excellent reviews for this hotel sadly i think the hotel is overrated and not great value for money   i booked a premium room without a view which overlooked some air conditioning units covered with green plastic foliage which was to be honest a little depressing and i wished id paid extra for a view the room itself was a decent size for parisian hotels and welldesigned and equipped there was a good surface on which to work a decent bathroom with bath and monsoon shower fulllength mirror comfortable chairs a large wardrobe with plenty of hangers and a large cupboard howevercouldnt have better things to say about hotel madison  highly recommend the staff was unbelievably friendly and accommodating so refreshing after a long flight from los angeles the hotel itself was idyllic and the location is perfect well definitely be backi stayed in the madison in 143 bled  st germain for  4 nights with my family great location very nice

package    exceeded our expectation on every count  airy meeting room with direct view to the church st germain des pres see picture  nespresso machine and tea included in the package with bottled water  free internet with good connectivity  most importantly  the lunch menu  tasty hot french brasserie food served directly at negotiation table  no small feat in locked down paris where all restaurants and bars are closed  extra bonus  the room service lady was so kind to bring us some free chocolates at request when she takes the dishes back after lunch  hats off to hotel management  all in i paid around half what regus would have charged for a similar meeting room with no view   andexcellent service by the staff the hotel manager mr alleau is incredibly helpful and generous with their time and advice the room was readpted to a meeting room with a nice ambient for zoom conferencegreat location for this hotel in saint germain we planned to stay for two nights but ended up staying over a week the hotel is very comfortable with nice furnishings they have a ton of outlets and even usb ports so there is never an issue of not having enough outlets the best thing is the location which is steps away from the church and many many shops during covid they can deliver breakfast to your room the only confusing part is your bill at the end as ours was not itemized and we couldnt figure it out easily as we kept extending nights i emailed them later for a full explanation i do need to double check our credit card for proper credits of the amounts we paid during our staywe stayed in this hotel for 3 nights first day we welcomed by bruno alleau hes very helpful and friendly the overall experience was great  great room and location very convenient to visit center in paris  thanks  wangcentral location and some rooms overlook saint germain church and are super cute however i had both a malfunctioning plug and no internet for 24 hours the staff could not give us update and didnt offer even a symbolic compensation not very nice when you have to work that spoiled the experiencethis was our second stay at the madison and it was wonderful the hotel has recently been remodeled and the rooms and common areas are beautiful the staff was also extremely attentive and incredibly polite you cant beat the locationright in the middle of everything st germaine including public transportation our only regret was that we couldnt stay longer our best to the staff and we hope they are able to weather the current worldwide storm we look forward to coming back to visit you soonwe try to stay here when we are in paris  it is a lovely hotel in an excellent location close to two metro stations and not far from major sites the staff are extremely efficient helpful and friendlywe stayed 3 days in this homy and inviting hotel in the heart of the lively st germain des pres we have been given a new stylish refurbished room overlooking the church good breakfast with

shops nearbyvisited the madison hotel few times beautiful and elegant hotel perfect location in saint germain with view to eglise de saint germain and cafe les deux magots tasty french breakfast

Hotel Moderne Saint Germain,i loved this place perfectly located amazing staff reception people were so kind and supportive funky rooms i got one on the 6th floor with a small balcony and great view on the street note street can get noisy in the nightearly morning but with the windows closed i could hear nothing also one weird thing was lack of bathroom door in my room but i think it was part of the concept my mother in law had a room on the 5th floor and there was a door present we havent tried the breakfast so cant judge it instead we went to the jozi cafe and i can highly recommend it as for moderne definitely a place to come back toi hate writing a bad review but while this hotel is in a great location and the staff is very friendly the rooms werent great aside from the very funky and velvety walls which i can definitely overlook there was a lot of black mold in the bathroom there is no ventilation in the bathroom and the mold is pretty prevalent so much so that i started to get sick from it the room itself is a bit dingy and the ac stopped working as well overall i wouldnt stay here againfriendly staff fun decor and excellent room for a hotel in such a great location this was very reasonably priced at 99 for a very comfortable twin room with balcony overlooking the lovely rue des ecoles in the latin quarter of paris  despite being in the centre of the city it was very quiet at night thank youfriendly staff fun decor and excellent room for a hotel in such a great location this was very reasonably priced at 99 for a very comfortable twin room with balcony overlooking the lovely rue des ecoles in the latin quarter of paris  despite being in the centre of the city it was very quiet at night thank youive been to europe before and knew that rooms are small there but the room in this hotel was a bit bigger than a broom closet i arrived there before 1100 am because i had just come from the airport from an overnight flight i knew i would not be able to check in until later but i just wanted to have my suitcase put in a storage closet until later in the day when i would be allowed to check in you would have thought i asked for a million bucks the desk clerk was sarcastic and rude he did put the bags in a closet finally but then i got a lecture about showing up early after checking in i was told that any time i left the hotel i had to leave my key at the front desk that was  annoying on the positive side the hotel is in a great location in the latin quarter neatmy husband and i along with his parents stayed here in mid october the location is great centrally located in the latin quarter very close to notre dame and easy walking to many attractions  yes the rooms are small but for location this is a perfectly acceptable amount of space my husband and our three large bags had no issues if youre expecting a large hotel room try paying 1000 a night   im reviewing this hotel mostly for the fantastic service of the front desk staff marie ariane and the others went beyond any expectations to make sure we were comfortable ordered taxis confirmed local not tourist prices and more i know americans expect french people and particularly parisians to be rude but i was so incredibly pleased with the staff at hotel le m andits a typical paris hotel with small rooms but it has ac and the nicest most helpful staff we have ever met it is within an easy walk to a metro stop and in good location for other sites within walking distance they even stored our bags for us after check out because our train didnt leave for a few hours we would definitely stay here againi have been to many hotels in paris see my other reviews over the years so i have a pretty reasonable understanding of what to expect  the location is outstanding i have previously stayed in this arearight next door at the hotel saint jacques in fact  this was my first stay at this hotel i booked this hotel for my sister and myself two single rooms on expedia with breakfast included we arrived very early in the day so our rooms were not ready we went out and about while the hotel locked our luggage in a secure room upon return at around 3pm our rooms were ready the staff were very pleasant when i went into my room it was fine nothing spectacular nothing ornate the room was very basica bed a closet with shelves and a desk with a chair it was not hugei went to paris from nov 21st to nov 27th and stayed at le m saint germain after a lot of research and almost booking with a mercure one and i must say i could not be happier that i chose them  upon arrival on a rainy wednesday afternoon i was received by marie at the reception who took care of my check in giving my advices and tips to get around paris as well as explaining rules and functioning of the hotel itself kindly i was informed that the room i could not have been given the room i had asked due to different categories but that i was put into the most similar one corresponding to my category  proceeding to my room on the 2nd floor i took the elevator which is fairly small 3 to 4 people no bags is the maximum it can handle room 24 is in front of thehotel is well located in the latin quarter checkin was nice and easy and the girl on reception was very friendly and accommodating but otherwise the service was generally lacking emailed the hotel 5 days prior to arriving and only got a response 1 day prior to arriving guys on reception generally sounding unfriendly and like any question was interrupting them rooms were very small but thats not uncommon for paris and for the price shower was a bit annoying as it didnt have a proper door and got the room wet quite often breakfast was fine continental stylenice modern accommodation anade of front desk staff was very helpful room was big and comfortable overall handy location louvre and notre dame in walking distance as is metro and bus lines we were on 6th floor and there are lofts only from ground to level 5 we had to carry heavy suitcases up to our level shower was open and there way no way to close anything offhave privacy otherwise this hotel is great accomodation in paristhe cleaning lady or someone of the staff stole our stuff from our room they were rude and they didnt care its outrageous everything about the hotel was a big disappointment the rooms are small noisy and smelly the corridors and the elevator were dirty the breakfast was poor and the same every day it is like a bad dormitory disgustingabsolutely nothing bad to say about this hotel location is great if youre coming to visit and walk around paris the rooms are very nice comfortable and clean service is impeccable and the french breakfast is very tasty the bread is just to die for  would totally recommend this hotel for either solo travelers as well as couples or familieswe stayed here in mid february and found this hotel to be darling we love the location very close to metro and rer plenty of places to eat a good dinner coffee pastries and near plenty of little grocery stores for snacks we stayed in the st germain de pres room and it was adorable we loved the views and city noise  it wasnt excessive but if you like a quieter room they may be able to accommodate   everyone employee we encountered at the hotel was friendly and helpful everyone spoke 3 languages quite impressive  we would stay here again and recommend this place to family  friends thank you so much hotel le m for a wonderful stayi have never been so disappointed with any service provider we were forced to leave the hotel because of the us stopping domestic flights and france closing their borders we had three nights including breakfast left and management wont even give us a credit to use in november of this year i refuse to stay here again because of this horrible customer service beyond anyones control   had they given us a credit i would have happily started here again despite the very small rooms lack of hot water in the evenings and mediocre breakfast the staff was friendly but i cannot tolerate or stomach such greed  take your money elsewherethis hotels convenient location is unbeatable it was our first time in paris and it was easy for us to get to all the mustsee attractions the quartier latin is a charming and safe area  the hotel seems to be newly refurbished we loved how cosy and stylish our room was i guess every room has a different layout and this uniqueness made our stay special  breakfast area is equally modern and breakfast is awesome  we will be backdont go to this hotel  this hotel treats guests like trash they are the worst hosts ever never in my life i saw such lack of cordially i have no words to describe the arrogance of the staff its unreal really worst hotel everthe hotel is so good and so nice room 32 with the saint germain graffitti is a must the staff is very helpful particularly kosky also great location just a few minutes from notre dame i love iti never thought i could stay over 3 months in the same hotel but i was in paris during the covid crisis and was lucky to book hotel le m saint germain since it was one of the few hotels that continued to remain open   the first things i noticed was the chic and modern style of the hotel and how each room has a different theme i spent my first few weeks in a red room on the 3rd floor and i absolutely loved it my favorite part of the room was the huge bathroom  on my third month the staff upgraded me to a double room with a balcony on the 6th floor it was bright and had a fantastic view of the 6th floor i quickly made this room my home  the place is very tidy and staff are always so accommodating and friendly and they treated me like family i especially enjoyedi hate writing a bad review but while this hotel is in a great location and the staff is very friendly the rooms werent great aside from the very funky and velvety walls which i can definitely overlook there was a lot of black mold in the bathroom there is no ventilation in the bathroom and the mold is pretty prevalent so much so that i started to get sick from it the room itself is a bit dingy and the ac stopped working as well overall i wouldnt stay here againannual trip to paris stayed at this hotel over 10 times now and always had a lovely timelocation great for getting around all paris has to offer and plenty of nice

was our second stay 5 nights in two years its a very comfortable hotel with a modern vibe in an absolutely  superb location we liked the cool decor   the nice fluffy slippers that used to await you in your room after checkin are gone now and the water glasses have been replaced by plastic ones also no more allday espresso and croissants that used to be available in the downstairs lounge  gone probably due to covid still we were happy there especially in our 6th floor room that had a tiny terrace with a nice view all the rooms are small but have plenty of storage space   one negative the rooms are frequently not cleaned until later afternoonearly evening which makes coming home for a break in the afternoon especially on a hot day to take a showerone of my favorite hotels now in paris

Despite being in the centre of the city it was very quiet at night thank youfriendly staff fun decor and excellent room for a hotel in such a great location.
Hotel Moliere,my husband and i stayed at hotel moliere for 5 nights while on vacation in paris we booked a traditional room and it was tastefully decorated comfortable and clean we always had fresh towels robes coffee water and tea and there was nightly turndown service the staff members are warm and courteous and always willing to help hotel moliere is in the first arrondisement and is close to the louvre palais royal place vendome garnier opera musee dorsay and a variety of fabulous restaurants and cafes that you can walk to the metro is also readily accessible from the hotel i would definitely recommend this little gem of a hotel and would not hesitate to stay here if i ever find myself visiting paris againthe best aspect of the hotel was the location rooms were also wellappointed  the worst was the noise we had a streetfacing room and we could hear the traffic as well as the laughter of people enjoying late nightsearly mornings using the outside seating of the restaurants in the street it is true that the street is not very busy but that does not help with the talking and laughter or when every once in a while a super noisy scooter speeds through  the issue is basically the choice of windowsones with 2 panes instead of 3 and in particular ones that have a permanent ventilation opening that cannot be closed and lets the noise straight through  service experience was soso and dependent on who was on duty most staff were very friendly but one came across ashotel moliere is my most favorite petite hotel in paris quaint quiet clean  a true oasis in busy paris convenient location to everywhere walking distance to the louvres champs elyses opra and rue saint honor i always look forward to staying there and the staff is incredible merci moliere

busy area the hotel staff are friendly the location is great metro line 6 edgar quinet is right outside the hotel we got the family room it was a bit small for a family room but thats the usual case in europe in general room was nice and clean so was the bathroom i had one minor issue with the additional bed it was joined just put together with another bed to make it as a full bed but it would slide away other than that everything was nicegood and clean hotel in montparnasse close to centre and metro walking distance to galleries la fayette gare de montparnasse jardin du luxembourg quartiere latin and key attractions near montparnasse  having a metro near by and a train station makes it easier for transportation plenty of restaurants to eat around the areagreat attention small room but with cozy spaces the location is very central hopefully the pillows can be improved to have even more pleasant rest the staff is really friendly and the cafe below is a jewelstaying at the odessa was perfect to visit the sights of paris great location and great accommodations staff was helpful knowledgeable and attentive to our needs also all spoke english which was very welcomedlovely hotel and our favourite place to stay we visit montparnasse at least once a year and hotel montparnasse is where we stay clean and comfortable with good facilities all the staff are absolutely lovely friendly and helpful we really love staying herewe went to odessa hotel for three nights and had a excellent holiday the people of the hotel were very polite and the room was clean and cozy the hotel is in a very good neighboorhood with a lot of nice bars and restaurants dont go to caf la libert the breakfast is delivered to your room and is very good for a small pricethe hotel odessa was a one night stop for us which was good as room was very small  hotel is clean close to train station so it worked out for our needs  close to many food choices also which was nicewe were passing through paris on our way to the dordogne and only needed lodging for one night  we wanted something close to gare montparnasse and tour montparnasse  the odessa filled this need very nicely  our room 53 had a small balcony wrapping around the corner on the fifth floor so we had a 270degree view  we had dinner just a couple of blocks away at the caf at the top of tour montparnasse after taking photos of the eiffel tower at sunset and the rest of paris spread out below us  in the morning it was a short walk to gare montparnasse to catch the tgv headed south  like many hotels in the mid price range the rooms are not spacious but for our shortterm purposes it was fine  if you are making connections out of montparnasse i recommend without hesitationmy spouse and i recently stayed at hotel odessa for two nights after two weeks in charentemaritime area of france this hotel is old as most are but the room was totally updated clean crisp linens comfy bed hot shower inroom safe attentive service near the hotel are dozens of restaurants of all descriptions cinemas and shopping it is a 20minute walk to the catacombs and the same distance in the other direction to luxembourg gardens montparnasse train station is a fiveminute walk with airport bus service directly behind it accessing the major sights of paris is easily accessible by bus or metro we highly recommend this hotel not only for its comforts but for the reasonable rate not often found in large citiesit is a quite small hotel but we had enough space for the whole family 2 adults  2 kids we had a baby bed which was very usefulthe rooms could be better acoustically isolated and ventilated but they are clean and were recently renovated the staff was very friendly and helpful wonderful location close to the railway station and in the heart of the montparnasse districtwe had a room on the 5th floor and stayed for 3 nights the room was small and outdated the walls were very thin you could hear the conversation in the next room old doors which made very loud noise especially when people came in late at night or left early in the morning good thing i had ear plugs or else i wouldnt have been able to sleep very much after we checked in we realized the room hadnt been cleaned properly trash from the previous occupants was still in the bathroom we asked at the reception for someone to come clean it but nothing was done until the next day when they normally cleaned the room the room had a bad odor probably from old rugs on the positive side the location of the hotel is very good lots of restaurants and bistros nearby a metro stop15  it was a great place to stay old building but well maintained all staff at the reception is really kind and friendly we will stay at this place again when if we go back to parisnot a bad hotel for paris other cities this would be a 25 rating hotel the beds were comfy bathroom was big and shower worked well and it is a very good location lots of cafes restaurants bars nearby and a few metro stops   my complaints would be room is a little small room had ac but was pretty weak even on high setting and the room key cards kept not working requiring us to constantly go back to the front desk to be recreatedgreat location near metro trains and excellent cafes and shops  cool hip neighborhood  within 30 minutes walking distance to catacombs luxembourg gardens louvre musee dorsay etc  the walks are wonderful but the metro can take you anywhere if you prefer  great staff friendly helpful very good with english really nice room overlooking cool street  excellent roomy bathroom with toilet and shower  clean and comfortable  worked really well for an adult family of 4i stayed at hotel odessa for five nights and i absolutely loved it i travel to paris at least once a year and i have tried many different hotels considering the price this is by far the best place i have stayed its a twostar hotel so one has to be reasonable rooms are small and basic but the neighborhood is excellent and you there are so many shops and bars cafes and restaurants that frankly you dont feel the lack of for example a coffee maker also the staff are so nice and helpful and professional this is a little gem and i hope they dont increase the price of course i am willing to pay a few dollars more if they decide to add toiletrieswe have stayed here twice now and love the hotel and area

Hotel Pavillon Bastille,my wife and i spent 4 nights at this hotel which is located just a short walk from the gare de lyon train station and just steps from the bastille round about our room was in the back facing a side street and it was very quiet the metro has lines just steps away plus many good restaurants we ate at le coq rico in the monmartre a la biche au bois two blocks away au temps des cerises just on the marais border and les coquettes de christian constant close to eiffel all of these restaurants offer terrific food at reasonable prices the room at pavillon bastille had a small coolerand available coffee and teathere is a large grocery about 1 12 blocks toward the train stationthe entire hotel was clean and well taken care of breakfast in the basement was also very goodvery reasonably priced hotel that is wellkept booked directly on site and received free breakfast cant complain about the bedroom and bathroom  comfortable and clean  its located very close to bastille station 5 minute walk and possibly a 15 minute walk to gare de lyon if you are driving it is conveniently located in front of opera house parking stationthis hotel was a nice surprise after having spent many nights in noisy andor uncomfortable paris hotels a small place just off the place de la bastille and lots of activity the hotel is surprisingly quiet with low internal traffic ie hallway chatter the rooms come with whatever you need from a clothesline in the bath to a minibar the staff is very accommodating and friendly and the morning breakfast is yummy and plentiful plus the coffee machine is ready to provide whatever you like from an espresso to a big cup of classic coffee i will certainly return mercithe best bit of this hotel is the staff  very friendly helpful especially since we arrived during a rail strike special thanks go to indural  who organised taxi transport back to cdg when the rotten sncf were on strike and there were no trains our room was in a perfect position  top floor at the end so noone next door to disturb us our room was also facing a side street so we had no traffic noise we did not have breakfast as all hotels charge far too much so we went to a local cafe which was only five minutes away we had a good selection of tv programmes  cnn bbc world and a few french sports programmes the hotel is in an ideal place for metro bars restaurants and visiting the local area would stay there again in an instanta nice hotel in a typical old french area of paris close to the center very comfortable and simple room in an old building flowered a really discret and friendly ambiance a great place to visit pariscant fault the location staff are welcoming and helpful and the rooms are clean with pleasant lighting the beds are as small as they come comfortable enough and it means a bit more floor space for the suitcases great to have a kettle in the room as well as coffee facilities in reception would stay againthe room was very nice and clean  however we had the desk call us a taxi on the morning of 1082021 and the driver charged us 421 to go to beauvais airport  we did expect to pay about 150 because of what we had researched but this was definitely wrong  i hope they dont continue  calling this taxi companyvery clean and tidy place is reasonably priced especially for the time of year tour de france good location where you can easily get to locations by half hour to fourth five minute walk or public transport 5 mins away beds are comfortable breakfast was average for a buffetif the prices were higher for this small chic hotel it would be called a boutique hotel but the news here is that it is everything that boutique hotels are but without the crazy prices   our double room was nicely decorated with a super comfortable bed and sleek bed covers and soft go to sleep pillows easy access wifi was a huge plus  as were the hefty towels in the bathroom which were lovely after a hot shower caveat  the hair dryer is a little strange so if thats important you might bring your own travel hair dryer    the staff speaks english and could not have been nicer when our flight was cancelled we called from the airport and the front desk was very accommodating about just giving us our same room   breakfast comes with the room  also a big plus  soeverything you would expect from a threestar hotel good central location being a couple of minutes from the metro station room clean and good size for paris hotel with comfortable bed and good quality linen excellent buffet breakfast with fresh croissant and pastries we will use this hotel againsmall cosy hotel just few steps from place de la bastille and metra line exit in font of lopera bastille the room size is typical for paris hotel but

from the metro from our arrival point on the eurostar with only a short stroll from bastille metro stop the lady at reception when we arrived was warm and friendly and thankfully fluent in english as our french was very limited we found the room small but more than adequate for a couple who were there only to sleep the bed was very comfortable ensuring a restful sleep and the room cleaned daily with a safe in the room we felt confident that passports and credit cards were safely left there we did not have breakfast at the hotel so unable to comment on this the price did however seem quite reasonable particularly when considering the cost of meals in paris it needs to be noted that thevery convenient place for stay in paris excellent access to any transport nice staff quiet rooms good start point to discover galeries historic buildings or follow the life in streets from typical cafswe had a very enjoyable couple of nights staying in this hotel the bed was very large and comfortable

ballet at opera bastillewe had a great experience staff of the hotel was friendly the rooms were clean and comfortable and the price was rightto top it off the hotel was on walking distance of the city centre at least for uswe had an overnighter here after finishing our 3 week cycle tour of southeastern france  the location was handy for getting cross town to gare du nord for our return leg  staff were friendly and couldnt really fault the room for a short stay  we might have been more forgiving due to our many nights under canvas on the bicycling tour   hotel has a useful side ramp for wheeled access to the lobby and a nice little gated outdoor area at the front   price was reasonable for paris and it was pretty much a standard type hotel  weve stayed in better and worse in our dozen or so visits to the cityfriendly nice little hotel clean budget about 100 eur per night are the first words coming to mind it is perfectly located at walking distance from bastille subway etc and also very close to the train station gare de lyon i walked there without problem  the room with 2 twin beds was spacious quiet thanks to good windows isolation a little noise from people passing through the corridor though with confortable bed simple but nice decoration and goodcreanfunctional bathroom the staff was very nice 24h   make sure to book directly from their website as the price is the same than other portals but more importantly they offer breakfast if you book with their site worth it to save a few bucks for a good and complete breakfast the croissants were to die formy husband and i stayed in this hotel for 8 nights on the first leg of our trip to europe in  september of 2019  we thought the hotel was very nice yes the rooms were a bit small but we did not feel cramped at all we had plenty of room for the little bit of time we spent in the room  we were surprised how quiet the area was  and we had a room facing rue de lyon it was very close to the bastille metro stop from where you could get everywhere after 8 days of riding the metro all over in paris we became very familiar with the system  the room and bathroom were very clean the bed and pillows comfortable we had very restful nights after exploring paris  we did not get the breakfast  as we wanted to go out and explore options for breakfast so i can not comment on,my wife and i spent 4 nights at this hotel which is located just a short walk from the gare de lyon train station. Our room was in the back facing a side street and it was very quiet the metro has lines just steps away plus many good restaurants. The staff is very accommodating and friendly and the morning breakfast is yummy and plentiful plus the coffee machine is ready to provide whatever you like.
Hotel Peyris Opera,stayed here with my family and checked in was a mess the staff were not friendly at all and quite arrogant the bathroom is filthy toilet is very small and i mean tiny the room is just not enough for familyhotel front desk receptionists alex  christian are very helpful kind polite knowledgeable more power to you guys we love this hotel especially the veranda hotel breakfast is pretty good we highly recommend this hoteleasy to access and surrounded by things to see places to eat and drink my room 107 was a corner room even a good size bathroom with bath unusual in any city centre good staff really helpful and friendly clean wifi brilliant and overall superb value strongly recommendedthe peyris hotel is a perfectly respectable clean and functional 3 star hotel however the staff are completely disinterested in providing anything other than an absolutely perfunctory service we encountered three different employees during our weekend visit and they all exhibited the same level of engagement and customer service poor we couldnt even get two extra tea bags at 10pm its not that the staff were rude just that they gave the impression they didnt want to be therestayed in a privilege triple room it was big particularly by parisien standards largely done up in black  white there were colourful drapes  cushions adding a welcome contrast to the look  ambience the bathroom was comfortably sized as well  had both a tub  a shower air conditioning useful on warm paris nights worked well the hotel is strategically located in a tourist friendly area just minutes from the opera house  the large department stores on boulevard haussmann 2 metro stations  cadet  grands boulevards  are located very close to the hotel  would likely take you to almost any place in paris that a tourist would expect to go to the area around the hotel is replete with cafes restaurants  eclectic shops  boutiques but being situated in a quietmy grandma and i stayed here for our two week trip in paris  the reception staff were extremely helpful with directionssightseeing and nothing was to hard for them to help us with they assisted with calling taxis arranging shuttle busses and provided maps for us to use they also assisted us with what areas to avoid due to demonstrations and marathons while on our trip  the room was enough for what we needed  would definitely come back again if im ever in paris again this place was the worst place we stayed in france  staff were rude read something written in french on our voucher and then laughed in face before showing vouchers to others and making them laugh  this did not set scene for a happy stay  we asked for an additional towel to deal with leaks in bathroom  and it took over three hours to arrive we were the first into breakfast and there was no juice available and no hot food  at least the bed was comfortable even if decor was questionablevery nice hotel with clean rooms friendly staff and close to metro station that brings you in just 10minutes directly to the city center we enjoyed every moment we cant wait to eventually come backlocation is a bit far from most sightseeing spots but there are good public transportation options  we were in room 215 which was very spacious and even had a balcony  the bathroom was spacious as well and clean  there is air conditioner in the room and small elevator fits one person with one suitcase or two persons with no suitcase front desk clerk were very pleasant and helpful breakfast available but we didnt try iti was due to stay at the hotel pax opera sister hotel of hotel peyris however due to a gas explosion near hotel pax there was no hot water in that hotel  the hotel contacted me through expedia where i made my booking before check in to inform me to go to hotel peyris  when i arrived the concierge was very helpful and was expecting me i was put into a larger room because thats all they had lucky me  the room was needless to say very spacious with a comfortable bed and pillows and blackout curtains the heating was excellent and amenities adequate i didnt have breakfast so cant comment on that  location was good  easy access to a couple of metro lines that get you right to the centre of paris  on my first morning the concierge was nice enough to warn me ofjust stayed a few days been here before  its ok usually but they have a bed bug problem see photo of one i notified them no compensation nothing i will now need to steam all of my clothes and bagage to make sure i dont get infested at home but they dont seem to carethis was my 3rd visit to paris and this time with parents i booked 2 rooms and it was fine decision their breakfast had satisfactory range and even we being vegetarian could have enough to eat    their service is good except sometimes one man at the reception was pretty rude and behaved like i am his boy or something our tv in room no 213 wasnt working and when i went to inform him he didnt speak well   rest all good oh yes decoration with black was terrible ie black carpets on floor black chairs and tables and even central heating was painted like smeared with tarwe spent two nights here during our tour of europe  the staff were very polite and helpful our room was charming and very clean breakfast was very nice  hotel was close to both train stations and was nicely situated in the theatre district  if you are planning to use the big bus hop on hop off the closest stop is the paris opera house  blue line  about a 20 minute walkas we walked in we had high hopes for this hotel our booking confirmation said we could check in at 230 we arrived just after 230 where we were told our room was not ready at 4pm we finally were able to check in after waiting in the lounge after a big day of travelling   we thought the room would give us a comfortable stay until we pulled back our sheets to our disgust a set of fake eyelashes were stuck to the inside of the quilt cover this was not okay and when staff were notified they delivered new sheets to the room for us to remake the beds ourselves   this was not okay and makes us believe that our room was not cleaned prior to arrival   other than this staff were nice breakfast was enough for a light breakfast and the location was great for everything we didcentrally located near metro rooms are small but clean  air conditioned ensuite hot water limited toiletries soapshampoocotton buds coffee  tea but no biscuits 1 bottle water on 1st night only  no fridge in room v small lift spiral stairs lovely staff continental breakfast only no other food they say theres a bar but there isnt really quiet at night given it was 40degrees c some cold water would have been nice  would stay here againfantastic location only a 15 minute walk away from the eurostar and airport train station the check in was average and i was not able to check in early but they had a secure storage room the room was so big for the price i was expecting a small room but it was large spacious and even had a little balcony the room was clean and bright and the bed huge and extremely comfortable would definitely stay at this hotel again  only negative is that in my room the shower doors were positioned in a strange way that meant you had to do some acrobatics to get in and out of the showergood area nice staff  luggage hold was a joke no security just a locked closet and they give the key to anyone the luggage hold was self service there is no checking in or checking out the luggage someone could easily steal someones bag without the receptionist having the slightest clue  the ac was broken 80 degrees our whole stay  the water temperature fluctuated cold hot cold hot the entire stay  i would not stay here againwe stayed here in april 2019  the room we were given was not the one we paid forwe required a room with twin beds which were supplied but the room was so small we could not move about safely  there was mould in the shower  when we complained we were told to go to the office the next day and we would be given another room  we did this but the manager had lied to us there was no room available we had to wait a second day for the correct room which was then supplied  we will not stay at this hotel again  we had booked in september 2018  there is no excuse for the hotel not supplying the correct room we found the stall arrogant and pushystopped here for 2 nights and cant say a bad word about the place  check in was a dream room ideal  clean tidy and comfy  located perfectly amongst restaurants bars and convenience stores a short walk to the nearest metro station and a 15min walk to central paris  staff couldnt do more for us exceptionally friendly  helpful at all times sometimes even a friendly hello when passing makes all the difference  would certainly stop here again and would highly recommend for value location cleanliness and friendly staffthe hotel was fine the room was clean the location was ok  close to gare du nord  the shopping area my room on the top floor was quiet but lots of sloping ceilings in the bedroom and bathroom made showering especially interesting and would be a challenge for anyone over 6ft tall the reception staff were not friendly in my experience guests seemed to be an interruption and an annoyance the requirements even during the day to swipe your room key or buzz a doorbell to gain entry was a small annoyance toowe stayed five nights at this charming hotel during our first visit to paris the hotel room was clean and comfortable the bathroom was not much more than a cupboard size and had no windows for ventilation but my understanding is that this is to be expected in paris as buildings are quite old and have been adapted to modern standards the continental buffet breakfast was excellent special mention for the freshly baked pastries we delighted in eating them every morning plus the fresh bread and cheese and meats there was a transport strike during our time there so we walked a lot and found the hotel centrally located lots of restaurants and a small supermarket located nearby with larger stores including galeries la fayette located within walking distance one tip the lift isvery small room bit shoddy staff where excellent though  really informative attentive and friendly we booked bed and breakfast but i think typical of most french hotels juice tea coffee and pastries toast and eggs nice area and central enoughwe stayed here in april 2019  the room we were given was not the one we paid forwe required a room with twin beds which were supplied but the

exceptionally friendly  helpful at all times sometimes even a friendly hello when passing makes all the difference  would certainly stop here again and would highly recommend for value location cleanliness and friendly stafffor the amount we paid to stay here was definitely not happy when i asked why the air conditioner did not work i was told that it would not be switched on until the end of may the last day of our stay was the 29th and the staffs solution was for us to leave our windows open there was no fly screen and we were the first floor above the lobby traffic was very loud and car horns were blaring at all hours layout of the bathroom was hopeless the door opened into the bathroom so far that you had to squeeze into a corner to get past it to the toiletwe stayed five nights

area and central enoughstayed here for 3 nights in may hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful location of hotel is as good as you are going to get for the price just a 20 minute walk from some of the major sights in parishorrible servicebad attitude location of hotel is great price is decent rooms clean but i wouldnt stay here again because of the horrible service and bad attitude i have no idea why the staff work here if they hate people staying in the hotel  the hotel itself is dingy and outdated and small our check in time was late because of a water heating problem we had booked 3 separate rooms there were 6 of us and when we got our rooms one mine did not have hot water  the lady at the receptionist who checked us in during the day was nice at times and then rude at others the no hot water issue wasnt a big deal the first day as we knew the hotel had had problems but i thought it was only for that first day i did not have hot water in my room the entire stay i had tothe hotel was fine the room was clean the location was ok  close to gare du nord  the shopping area my room on the top floor was quiet but lots of sloping ceilings in the bedroom and bathroom made showering especially interesting and would be a challenge for anyone over 6ft tall the reception staff were not friendly in my experience guests seemed to be an interruption and an annoyance the requirements even during the day to swipe your room key or buzz a doorbell to gain entry was a small annoyance too,stayed here with my family and checked in was a mess the staff were not friendly at all and quite arrogant the bathroom is filthy toilet is very small and i mean tiny the room is just not enough for family hotel front desk receptionists alex  christian are very helpful kind polite knowledgeable more power to you guys we love this hotel especially the veranda hotel breakfast is pretty good we highly recommend this hoteleasy to access and surrounded by things to see places to eat and drink.
Hotel R de Paris,i would just like to say that i have recently returned for a 3 night stay at hotel r de paris and what a lovely hotel i travelled to paris just before the current covid situation became as severe as it has and even during this difficult time the staff were so friendly  so helpful and always had a smile on their faces  i cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and i just hope that the current situation that is effecting us all does not effect this hotel and its staff when things do resume   in terms of location it is perfect a 20 minute walk from gate du nord  i would recommend walking if you do not have too much luggage as its a pleasant stroll and very straight forward  but there is metros nearby if needed conveniently located between montmartre and the departmentthis is a cute hotel in the heart of everything  the rooms were small as you would expect for the area but comfortable  everything you need is there including a teapot for afternoon tea  the staff was friendly and accommodating  there is air conditioning for people who are used to that  having breakfast onsite was convenient and very good  i look forward to staying againwhile its a little off the beaten path it is very close to a metro station with the rest of paris at your doorstep service was excellent and the the room was clean comfortable and stylish the service from the front desk staff was excellentjust finished a great stay at the hotel r de paris the rooms at the hotel are in excellent condition and spacious for paris i was in one of their executive rooms which even had a private balcony with nice views   the staff is great very friendly and providing any requested information  the location is also excellent with around a 10 minute walk to big department stores  overall i would highly recommend the hotel r de paristhis hotel is situated in an excellent location close to many amenities and the many great attractions in paris the hotel offers very well presented and nicely decorated rooms although the space is small like every hotel in paris the room is well organised the hotel also has a lovely little reception area for breakfast and has a well equipped gym and sauna we were impressed with this especially as the hotel is so central   the staff are also very friendly and helpful we were particularly grateful as we had initially booked our stay during the paris strikes and had to rebook as the eurostar was not running despite booking on a nonrefundable date the hotel kindly honoured our booking and allowed us to change dates to which we were very grateful  we would definitelyhotel staff were very friendly the room was exactly the same as in the pictures the bathroom was clean and tidy  perfect for a romantic weekend very central

only issue i would recommend this to anyoneits my first time at hotel r  i seem to get a different hotel im in paris which happens more times per month than i ever thought it would  but its been pleasant id say that the rooms are above standard for most hotels in this range ive tried at least 5 so far this year im in a smaller room this time trying a superior room in a couple of weeks anyway its clean well decorated very modern and the bathroom is quite nice except for the fact it has a tub and not a shower  why why would you do that in 2020 i havent had breakfast but the dining room looks very nice ill try tomorrow for some drinks reception was very good the gentleman when i arrived was charming and efficient so why not 5 stars two reasons the internet is absolutely atrocious

hotel r de paris from the 9th march to the 14th march 20 the staff were superb informative and friendly the hotel rooms were modern spotlessly clean and well designed breakfasts were served daily and are excellent value also snacks are available throughout the day free of charge the hotel is situated in an ideal location for sightseeing activities around paris it is near the metro and taxis abound day and night it is such a pity that countries are being shut down during this terrible coronavirus but we will most certainly like to stay at the hotel again in the not too distant futurewe picked hotel r for our last night in paris after returning from amsterdam we had an early flight in and were able to check into our room early around 1100am which was a great surprise our room was very comfortable and the hotel itself was clean great location and quiet   we were meant to leave the next morning to get our flight back to the us but my husband became ill with what we now think was extreme stomach poisoning we did not eat at the hotel he was sick enough that we couldnt get on our flight and instead had to go to the er to make sure he was okay i wish i had gotten the employees name who helped us call a cab talked to the cab drive in french and told him exactly where to go and was just so compassionate when we returned the same employee was therethe staff have been amazing and made this feel like a home we are here for a 2 week stay and on day 3 they asked if i wanted to switch rooms to a lower floor access to an outside area since they noticed i smoked they offered to move us at no additional cost they have given fantastic recommendations and have been incredibly sweet  book your paris stay here you wont regret itperfect location close to the metro and a very quiet room the  real great thing about this hotel is fiona from the front desk she will help you with anything actually listen and gives you the feeling there is nothing to much to askwe stayed for 2 nights and had a lovely stay the staff were very friendly and helpful the reception area is very clean modern and stylish and the room was very comfortable   we were lucky and were given an upgrade to a delux room for our stay  whilst the rooms are small as to be expected in paris they are beautifully decorated and in immaculate condition it had everything we needed as well as a tv hidden in the mirror which was very cool  we had to preorder breakfast due to covid 19 which was brought to our room which personally i loved as it was like have fresh continental breakfast in bed no hot food on the menu however which my friend was disappointed with but i loved the fresh fruit baguettes and pastries   we didnt use the gym in the basement but had athe staff was great and welcoming and the whole experience was very pleasant due to covid the breakfast could have been better but overall it was great the sauna and hammam space is beautiful and clean i would very recommend the hoteli cannot

Hotel Raphael,i stayed for a week the room is great spacious even huge roof top beautiful great breakfast too but there are many carpets and even fabric on the wall the one in the wardrobe then smells a lot i got a horrible allergy especially when i turned on the air conditioner  on the third day barely breathing i went down at night and asked a nice man if there was an alternative he wrote down my name and asked me to look for them in the morning to see if they could do a better cleaning or if there was a room with less smell   the gentleman told me it was hotel style that all rooms were the same i saw another friend in a room that at least had no fabric on the wall like mine nothing was made  i complained again the next day with another attendant they were to return mewe had a terrific stay at hotel raphael it has a wonderful old paris style and has a rich history the location is terrific as well everyone we met who worked there was as nice as could be and spoke good english the concierge was able to arrange our eu vaccine passports in advance which saved us the trouble of getting tests for every other country we visited they also got us reservations where ever we asked and knew about all the museums and sights and dont miss the rooftop barreally just a very luxurious experience wonderful service wonderful and friendly staff beautiful hotel and room the only thing i would say that could be better is the breakfast which was perhaps not great value for moneywhat a wonderful hotel to view and visit christos wrapped arc de triomphe the roof terrace is amazing and offers 360 degrees views including arc de triomphe very close and tour eiffel and if you have any doubts about the location  its right next to the famous the peninsula hotel which costs four times as much but has a significantly worse view from its terrace to the arc de triomphe its less than 5 minutes walk we were really amazed and took the opportunity to visit the arc de triomphe many times last weekend thanks a lot to the whole raphael team we had a great timeit is a beautiful place with a great views from the roof everybody greeted us and smiled to make our day better  i would have given it 5 stars but unfortunately not the whole staff is that great  being chased by the barman up on the roof because we are taking pictures was very insultingreally just a very luxurious experience

great  being chased by the barman up on the roof because we are taking pictures was very insultingsuperb view of the eiffel tower and excellent atmosphere the staff is perfect and the cocktails very good we were staying right next to the peninsula and enjoyed the more cozy atmosphere of the raphaels terracewe truly enjoyed our stay at the hotel raphael  it was so very memorable  everyone was friendly helpful and interested in making our stay enjoyable the two attentive staff membersboth named alexandre as well as pascal who facilitated our airport transfers and aude who was always so friendly at the reception desk  i also want to  thank jacque francois who was so kind as to find a way to freeze our butter purchases so i could bring them back to the states  the suite was large elegant and refined furnished with many antiques  we enjoyed two bathrooms a large sitting room and all the extras anyone could ask for balcony windows opened on to each of four small pediments where one could see and enjoy the streets of paris words cannot due justice to the beauty ofwe were a large group composed of americans from a wide range of states and europeans from several countries camille allenic managed our group and set up all the logistics from parking to rooms to dinners she went above and beyond to help us out as we had a lot of moving parts doing a tour de france cycling trip  her help and professionalism made a world of difference once there all the people we interacted with from conciergerie team to reception were impeccable joel cochin especially was attentive and we so enjoyed seeing him at our breakfasts and dinners that it was like he was a part of our group everything was beautifully laid out and no request seemed too much the raphael team carries themselves with a perfect blend of professionalism and pride yet also interactingwe stayed in the hotel as a couple in july 2021 in the eiffel tower terrace suite and enjoyed every minute   great room splendid house memorable view excellent service perfect location and everything you can ask for in a 5 star hotel   outstanding communication ahead with the front desk for arranging special requests and they delivered in every category  highly recommended and we cannot wait to be back sooni just came back from another wonderful stay at the hotel raphael  i have stayed there many times and was so glad to make this my first visit once travel restrictions were lifted  the hotel is different than all other highend hotels in paris  the style and architecture exude belleepoque paris yet it also has a quite intimate feel  the service and especially the concierge is wonderful always at the ready to help  the location is excellent  right by the etoile with lots of connections by metro to the rest of paris  the rooms are incredibly spacious  the largest hotel rooms ive ever stayed in and very quiet  the beds are very comfortable  to top it all off the hotel has a magnificient rooftop bar with excellent views of the the arche di triomphe and the tourwe stayed 2 nights in the eiffel tower suite and had a wonderfull stay we have been in most 5 stars in paris but the raphael exceeded our expectations usually we prefer more modern decoration but this time we tried a genuine french experience and it was really a pleasure  from the quality of the room to the kindness of the staff everything is perfect the location is perfect and the rooftop is one of the best hidden gem in paris price wise this is by far the best 5 stars you can find in parisit is the most parisian of all hotels french luxury knowhow and perfect service they have the most beautiful roof top in paris le raphael is the  perfect place to live the parisian experience for a week end we booked this hotel before covid had swept the world our trip was planned for march 2020 and was completely canceled due to having to quarantine 14 days and just to be safe  after all it was the beginning of the pandemic and we were planning to travel with children we did not ask for a refund just a voucher to stay in the future because we plan to visit paris as soon as it is safe they denied us anything and had zero customer service and again we asked for a voucher  not a refund i understand they are a smaller hotel but expected way more from a 5star property it was also for my birthday beware  do not book this during the pandemic you will completely lose your money if you dont gostaff very friendly and helpful breakfast wonderful highly recommend very centrally located making getting around very simple walking and using the subway beautiful barlounge that was quite popular at night iwe booked this hotel due to its location and rooftop terrace to watch the fireworks  ive stayed in paris many times before and the customer service is hit or miss  first thing is i have to say the customer service at this hotel was top notch  the doormen and concierge were always so kind and helpful  when asked questions the concierge was responsive and helped us book reservations right away   the front desk staff was also very welcoming  however when we got to our room we were surprised that there were so many cracks and chipped paint in areas  there was also mold in our bathroom  we reported our disappointment in the room and we were loved to another room the next day  they were apologetic and gave some free goodies and also comped our ny day brunch 130ppi booked my room via bookingcom i arrived late in the evening after a long busy day traveling and business dinner the check in was smooth the lobby and room looked elegant at first glance there was delicious welcome cakes waiting in the room too i got room 015  the big horrible surprised hit me in the morning when entered bathroom which was a worn down bathroom with cracked tiles rusted faucets fittings and shower head and worst enough black mould at the corner of bath tub and with a discolored dusty hairdryer hangin there there was a new one in the room but look this one was horrible the worst and most unbeleivable part came i saw a smal half an inch cockroach walking on the wall right below towel rack if i had seen this last night i could not sleep there atthis old hotel is said to be historic building the rooms are large almost twice the size in paris the furniture is old bed is comfortable clean bathrooms the staff at front desk and restaurant are very courteous location is good 3 minutes to etoile and to many good restaurants its roof top has a great view of eiffle tower and arc de triompexcellent service from the concierge to the check in a good sized room with a very comfortable bed a good bathroom with a knockout shower and the lovely bar anglais my wife and i had a great stay and we very much intend to returnhotel raphael was an older hotel but very well kept  the rooms were big and we had a king bed  the bathroom had a separate toilet room and there was a tubshower combo  the concierge was nice but they only recommended upscale places to eat and we were looking for more casual places  we just wanted a bakery type quick breakfast before we went on our tour and they really couldnt come up with any suggestions overall it was a nice clean hotel but a bit pricey and stuffywe stayed here a few days ago property is clean staff reasonable helpful and location is convenient   however  the breakfast is a  significant rip off unless it is included in your stay we were charged 72 euro for breakfast for two    the pricing in the menu is confusing and part of the problem  example    omelette 12 sausage 4 tomato spinach cheese mushrooms 3  what this means is that you will pay 24 for an omelette that includes 4 ingredients  9 for coffee and tea  downhill from there   in addition it is virtually impossible to control the water temperature for a shower the water literally goes from freezing cold to scalding hot   avoid this hotel if you plan to take a shower or eat breakfast at the hotelspent a week there in midaugust with my girlfriend in the eiffel tower suite great hotel the room was fabulous the view from the terrace looking out over the eiffel tower was sublime and the service and the hotel staff was onpoint   id definitely stay here again a great hoteli was there for a drink on the rooftop terrace and it was an incredible experience the service was excellent and the atmosphere is very nice and intimate the rooftop has probably the best view in all of paris you can see very well the arc de triomphe eiffel tower and the sacre coeur amazing location close to the champs lyses highly recommendwhat a massive disappointment i booked this room to share with my father solely due to the fact that there was a possibility to have 1 king bed and 1 twin bed i would have never stayed at this hotel if this option was not advertised tripadvisor does not allow screenshots to be posted for travel photos but in the confirmation from the hotel it clearly states in english that 1 king bed and 1 twin bed are being offered   when we got up to the room there was only 1 king bed 2 twin beds pushed together i informed the employee of the mistake that we did not purchase this room and needed the room with 1 king bed and 1 twin bed he told me that this was not an option anywhere in the hotel and that there is confusion in the confirmation and terms of purchase it says word formy wife and i planned a spur of the moment 40th wedding anniversary trip to paris  we chose this hotel as it was centrally located  it was everything that had been written  the room deluxe suite was comfortable well appointed and well maintained  the staff was attentive helpful and accommodating to any need  the rooftop view at twilight was spectacular  they provided recommendations to pharmacies that gave covid tests be aware that not all pharmacies know the rules to reenter the us  on the negative side their restaurant only served cold food as it is not fully opened since covid  i am sure that this will change over time  i would definitely return againi was extremely disappointed on arrival  firstly i found the reception most unwelcoming and somewhat grumpy  our food was very over priced and dreadful  albeit my sons burger was was raw inside and my chicken was so over cooked  the room was so in need of redecorating with paint peeling and very dirty brown carpets  not a single piece of art on the wall the rooms really reminded me of my grandmothers nursing home  whilst i adore traditional hotels this is so dated and scruffy in areas not to mention the very rough sheets i had to sleep in and hard pillows  i also discovered that instead of a mattress protector they had used a bath towel   service slow and not friendly and over all i was very disappointed  reallt this is a 3 star hotel as it stands in my opinion  do,i stayed for a week the room is great spacious even huge roof top beautiful great breakfast too but there are many carpets and even fabric on the wall the one in the wardrobe then smells a lot i got a horrible allergy especially when i turned on air conditioner  i complained again the next day with another attendant they were to return mewe had a terrific stay at hotel raphael it has a wonderful old paris style and a rich history the location is terrific as well everyone we met who worked there was as nice as could be.

worth every penny  the service was top notch very helpful staff great location at very reasonable prices  thank you for a wonderful stayvery practical location in the centre of paris my room was a good size and very clean the hotel is well looked after and common parts very attractive a couple of areas for improvement the carpet in a corner of my room was in a terrible state like it had been eaten by moth or just worn to the threads it just brought down the whole room as did the freestanding cupboard when all the furnishing was so nice this looked a bit like a super cheap unit painted which stuck out a bit lastly although i was on the 6th floor at 630am i could smell the fumes of breakfast being prepared ventilation of the kitchen should be better separated from the roomsour group had a lovely stay at the hotel relais bosquet in paris  the location was perfect with respect to ease of access to buses and the metro  getting around was simple and safe  the rooms were small but clean the breakfast was a good value and the staff was helpful  our only complaints would be that the carpets and linens could stand refreshingi stayed 6 nights and couldnt have been happier with this boutique hotel the  reception staff was so pleasant and helpful in giving me directions everyday  on the metro or city map the location was fantastic with a short 2 blocks  to the metro which will get you anywhere in paris to see the sights or hop on the train to versailles or long distance travel reception gave me clear written directions from the train station which metro to take to etolle militaire stop to walk 2 blocks to the hotel   rue cler street with all the cafes and shops is just a 12 block away from the front door there is a market and bakery a couple of doors away a pharmacy 2

and saintgermain des prs close to main metro stations montparnasse rennes and st placide stations a clean and well equipped hotel with a good quality cost ratio the breakfast is generous and takes place in a  well furnished and equipped room the size of the bedrooms and bathroom are comfortable and well above parisian standards the staff is friendly and helpfulwe had four nights at the hotel good location if you want to stay in the saint germaine all the staff were helpful and friendly but a special mention goes to alain who went out of his way to help us purchase a train ticket to aix provence nothing was any trouble for him thank yougreat location with loads of bars and restaurants on your doorstep hotel was really nice small but very cosy the staff were very good and all in all we totally enjoyed our stay i would be clutching at strays to find a fault so i wont good jobwe loved the salon that had drinks and snacks available around the clock  air conditioning was perfect for the summer heat  close to the train station and good shopping  only downside was our toilet seat needed to be securedthe hotel is really charming the rooms are nicely decorated the beds are huge and incredibly comfortable and the location well location is amazing really close to gare montparnasse unfortunately there were some issues during our eightdaylong stay on the first day we realized that the water was standing in the shower we have reported it to the reception staff on the second day we have reported it again on the third day my fearless wife had put her hand into the drainage hole and pulled out the bunch of hair left there by the guests living in this room before we considered taking it home as a freaky disgusting souvenir  but then we thought again and threw it into the toilet not the smartest move as now the toilet got blocked in the end of the day we askedwed both been to paris before so we wanted a different view the real paris not the tourist view and we found it the latin quarter 6th arrondissement gives you all you need and the royal saint germain hotel was perfect both location wise and value for money the staff were very friendly and friendly and the room was absolutely fine it was clean it was spacious the shower was excellent and even though it was in a main road it was quiet our room included breakfast too definitely recommendmy wife and i used this hotel when we went to see our son run the paris marathon the room was cleaned every day and the reception staff were very helpful  the rooms are quite small with not much space for your clothes however the beds are very comfortable we did not use the breakfast service as there are many local cafes offering better value for moneythe room did not live up to the impression in the photos whilst the lobby was lovely and renovated the room 15 was dingy smelt and noisy  the shower pressure was good despite the broken tap and the water was hot  the tiles in the bathroom were moldy as was the roof due to a complete lack of ventilation in the bathroom i could also hear something running in the bathroom all night so i had to shut the door too in order to get sleep   the room was small expected for a parisian hotel but was made worse by the hotel taking up the only space in the closet with a token mini fridge and kettle the bed wasnt particularly comfortable but made worse with the thin and yellowed pillows if you manage to get a low room rate then its fine but as it was in demand the weekend ithe reception is situated under a stair casethe room was not ready before1700 the room was very small for a 3 the front desk did not have any experiencei wanted to book the moulin rouge with dinner and show they told me he did not know and he does not do that the breakfast was okhotel is well located between 3 metro stations rooms are small and  somber with a tiny bathroom but include a bath beds are good and our window was openable expensive for similar rooms in paris staff were pleasant but i informed 3 people on 3 days that the door lock was not lockable from inside or outside nothing was done and i took my own security measures didnt try the breakfast the lift is modernpretty small and run down rooms but i guess for a 3 star hotel is normal carpet is dirty in the room hallway very narrow blocked by supplies cleaning person not the best found my pajamas on the floor couple times garbage not removed from the room at least once for a 200 a night that cancelon charged and no breakfast included i was expecting better servicesi stayed in the royal st german hotel with my daughter and granddaughter in a three bedded room the room was well decorated very clean lovely bedding and towels they had supplied most extras which included tea and coffee making toiletries tissues hairdryer etc the only complaint with the room was a wardrobe door that was unable to be moved the staff were very friendly and helpful the breakfast was good and during the day croissants cake drinks and nibbles were left out in the dining room for the guests to help themselves the position of the hotel was excellent the metro from the gare du nord was only approx 9 stops to the nearest station which was saint placide and then just a short walk to the hotel the hotel is surrounded with lots of shops and cafes and has aclose to montparnasse station  quieter than expected given the location  room was small but adequate  only complaint was breakfast area  it was very small there werent many tables and you had to get your coffee cup and plate from the table placesetting  most days the tables hadnt been reset so you had to scrounge for a coffee cup and silverware  the staff seemed to have difficulty keeping up with restocking hot food as well  the food itself was fine,i stayed here for a weekend in october of 2016  dont ask me what took me so long to write the review  just know that a few years later i still remember how much i enjoyed my stay a friend and i arrived the afternoon of my birthday and had a seamless checkin process.

Hotel Signature St Germain des Pres,we had booked to stay in another hotel who then emailed me a week prior to our trip to say they would not be open on the day we arrived well they did us a favour because we discovered this absolute gem of a hotel  delphine and the rest of the team were so friendly and welcoming  nothing was too much trouble they booked restaurants for us  advised on covid testing provided a kettle and a corkscrew and were just generally lovely people our room no 21 was delightful  two huge windows and a balcony with table and chairs  overlooking the street out side the front of the hotel the dcor was beautiful the bathroom fabulous and the beds were really really comfy  we slept like logs we had breakfast there on the last day and it was delicious  fruit salad and cereals ai can not say enough good about this hotel but heres an example of how they go above and beyond i had written before i arrived as my flight landed early in the morning and i wanted a place to leave my bags they said theyd note my early arrival and see if my room could be ready for a complimentary early check in when i arrived at 1030 am my room was ready the breakfast was pleasant the front desk usually staffed by the owner was always willing to provide my great directions and advice i feel that traveling to a different country can be intimidating but this hotels hospitality makes it so much easierthe staff was extremely accommodating they booked and helped us out with museum tickets dinner reservations breakfast venues travel tips plus put our minds at ease regarding areas to visitshop currency and customs they became our best friends as we were welcomed so warmly every time we saw them the central location was key to our plans everything was within walking distance or near a subway id highly recommend this hotelwhat made this hotel exceptional is the amazing staff most of them were very helpful and went out of their way to help us with planning directions transportation and recommendations alice was just fantasticmy husband and i had the pleasure to stay at hotel signature st germain des pres in august we had such an enjoyable stay our room was perfectly appointed with a balcony as well the beds are oh so comfortable what was most exceptional about this hotel is the amazing staff they were so friendly and accommodating and went out of their way to make our stay perfect the hotel is also located conveniently to everything in paris and the neighborhood of st germain is very quaint thank youi stayed here with my mom on a trip to paris this august and everything about this hotel was wonderful it is in a perfect locationthere are many restaurants within walking distance and le bon march offers plenty of shopping right down the street  it is within walking distance to the louvre muse dorsay etc but there is a metro line right around the corner as well the room was greatquiet clean and comfortable manuela delphine and alice are all a delight and so helpful for anything you might need they arranged transportation to and from the airport and gave excellent recommendations they really do feel like our family in paris which made our trip so amazing we cant wait to come backstayed 3 nights with my daughter  we each had a superior room on the 6th floor with a small balcony  the rooms although small were clean and quiet with a very comfortable bed desk and open closet  they provided free bottled water in the room and a refrigerator stocked with a few soft drinks and juices which were reasonably priced  the tiled bathroom was very small but adequate  as mentioned in other posts the staff are very nice and provided great restaurant recommendations as well as help with everything with from airport transportation to where to get a covid test  the neighborhood is great with plenty of cafes shopping easy access to the metro and walking distance to many tourist sites  highly recommend the hotel signaturemy son and i had the pleasure of staying here this august in paris i cant say enough about how much we loved this hotel all the staff obviously love and are passionate about the hotel and treat all the guests like family they quickly learned what we liked for breakfast and had it on hand every morning without us even requesting and one morning when i left my travel mug in the breakfast room i found it washed and in our room when we returned that afternoon the rooms are lovely bright and comfortable the location is perfect 2 minutes walk to the metro walking distance to major sights and with the addition of the warmth and welcome that the staff brings we would give more than five stars if we could we have attached a picture of the view from our room  such amy wife and i had the pleasure of visiting this hotel in august i cant say enough good things about it if there was a possibility for six stars i would give it the staff at this hotel are a customer service dream team absolutely stellar i was so impressed at how eager they all were to go above and beyond and help with planning or transportation advice or dinner or sightseeing suggestions  the location is very central and is probably one of the tidiest hotels that i have ever stayed in so many little nice and thoughtful touches made our stay there absolutely unforgettable there is a very nice breakfast that costs extra but it is well worth it also there is a metro station just a block away but most sightseeing destinations are walking distance away  i would staywe cannot review the hotel per se as we had to cancel our trip but i wanted to acknowledge the professionalism and kindness shown by them in changing our plans  incredibly helpful  we hope to stay there as soon as we can reschedule our tripi stayed here on my last night in paris the receptionist at the front desk was kind enough to give me the choice between the two rooms a larger one on the second floor and a smaller one with a view of the eiffel tower on the sixth floor i choose the room on the second floor it was a nice room with a terrace small by american standards but comfortable and nice i did find 3 or 4 stray hairs on the bed and in the bathroom otherwise i was happy with the room and my stay the location was perfect for exploring saint germain des presi had not been to paris in decades and the signature hotel made our stay even better than expected  comfortable clean room with a great bed excellent customer service and a perfect location  quiet the staff was helpful and very friendly and gave us some good tips in addition to the usual ordering of taxis etc  i would definitely stay here again and recommend it highlywe returned to this hotel for our 3rd stay because it suited us so well  a small boutique hotel which actually functions well  our prestige room is very large by french standards and is located on an inner courtyard  we place a priority on quiet and functionality  king sized bed high quality linens very large bathroom with tub and walk in show  a separate wc is a plus  breakfast is optional and extra at 14 eurosperson  the accommodations weve had and the entire hotel is very designerly  we like the location with a variety of restaurants small boutiques and close by museums  most and perhaps best of all the reception staff are very helpful and fluent in english a pluswhat really is the hidden gem of this hotel is the staff they were super friendly and helpful they were always quick with great suggestions and handled a lot of the details for our trip like arranging tours airport transportation and went to the local flower market so we had fresh flowers in our room we stayed in the prestige room it was very spacious and well appointed the view was of the interior courtyard we paid for the in house breakfast and enjoyed a filling meal before heading out each day when we return next to paris the hotel signature will be our home away from homemy mom and i recently stayed at hotel signature to celebrate her birthday in paris and it was an outstanding experience from start to finish  key highlights  exceptional customer service every single person we interacted with at the hotel were so kind and helpful above and beyond what you would expect at a nice boutique hotel in paris  location walking distance or a quick uber ride to major attractions shopping restaurants etc  prestige room quiet clean fresh scent good space for two people lovely bathroom with fluffy towels and luxury products  there is a reason for the really high rating and im so glad i found this gem through the reviews highly recommend would return again for our next trip  sincere thanks for making our trip extra specialthis hotel is in a wonderful locations lots of good restaurants and fabulous patissieres and the rooms darling and well appointed but tres small  even though the rooms are really small they have added shelving and storage  so very well  the staff is so very welcoming and friendly and

marche  wonderfuljust back from another stay at hotel signature and will go back again the location is perfect for me the room comfortable and the breakfast of fresh bread yogurt and cheese a great

including making all the arrangements for my covid test that i needed for reentry in the us i look forward to seeing them againwe returned to this hotel for our 3rd stay because it suited us so well  a small boutique hotel which actually functions well  our prestige room is very large by french standards and is located on an inner courtyard  we place a priority on quiet and functionality  king sized bed high quality linens very large bathroom with tub and walk in show  a separate wc is a plus  breakfast is optional and extra at 14 eurosperson  the accommodations weve had and the entire hotel is very designerly  we like the location with a variety of restaurants small boutiques and close by museums  most and perhaps best of all the reception staff are very helpful and fluent in english a pluswhat really is the hidden gem of this hotel is the staff they were super friendly and helpful they were always quick with great suggestions and handled a lot of the details for our trip like arranging tours airport transportation and went to the local flower market so we had fresh flowers in our room we stayed in the prestige room it was very spacious and well appointed the view was of the interior courtyard we paid for the in house breakfast and enjoyed a filling meal before heading out each day when we return next to paris the hotel signature will be our home away from homemy

person we interacted with at the hotel were so kind and helpful above and beyond what you would expect at a nice boutique hotel in paris  location walking distance or a quick uber ride to major attractions shopping restaurants etc  prestige room quiet clean fresh scent good space for two people lovely bathroom with fluffy towels and luxury products  there is a reason for the really high rating and im so glad i found this gem through the reviews highly recommend would return again for our next trip  sincere thanks for making our trip extra specialjust back from another stay at hotel signature and will go back again the location is perfect for me the room comfortable and the breakfast of fresh bread yogurt and cheese a great start to the day but the most important reason for my returning here is the staff they are always welcoming but on this stay they really went the extra mile to help me navigate the new requirements including making all the arrangements for my covid test that i needed for reentry in the us i look forward to seeing them againyou will feel welcomed at every turn this 4 rated boutique hotel provides all you will need for a fun stay in paris the staff goes the extra mile for all the guests with a smilei was greatly assisted by alice in making an appropriate car rental for our departure i had failed miserably doing this online she called directly to assure an adequate vehicle was provided just one example of the everyone on the staffs commitment would not stay anywhere else  ps  this was a postponed  stay from 2020 by covid they were a pleasure to deal with even with these stressful circumstancessmall charming hotel warm well come stuff clean and located in the heart of saint germain second time here not disappointed we are definitely coming back rooms  are wonderful decorated bed is very comfortable big bathroom with all facilitieswe had a lovely large room particularly for parisian standards  the staff here could not be nicer  they helped us with directions restaurant recommendations and reservations before our arrival and while there taxis etc  they had a very nice reception for the guests one evening with delicious wine and hors doeuvres  the hotel is very quiet and conveniently located  we would definitely stay here againthis was our second time at hotel signature the first was a wonderful stay and the most helpful staff so we stayed here with friends when we were in paris again our friends were overwhelmed by the incredible staff and support provided they provided restaurant recommendations and directions and made the reservations manuela who provided all of the assistance is simply incredible always a smile and always helpful the hotel is centrally located right down the street from bon marche and great people watching we had an easy walk to notre dame and the rooms were more than adequate for such a prime paris location it also turned out that this was the hotels 9th anniversary of the current owners and invited all the guests to participate in their celebration in the lobby nicejust finished a 5 night stay in this delightful boutique hotel for my wifes birthday selected the hotel based on reviews and am so glad i did or room was well appointed and cozy with a very nice balcony overlooking the quiet little street of rue chomel the hotel has an excellent location close to the metro and many fine little cafes the best part of our experience was the wonderful staff everyone was delightful and helpful a very special mention to the lovely manuela we had been to paris numerous times and had some favorite restaurants we wanted to make reservations for before we even checked in reservations were made for us and manuelas tips on getting around to some places we hadnt been to before were invaluable  on nights we didnt have specific plans alice andwe stayed at hotel signiture st germain twice in the last month it was absolutely perfect and truly a hidden gem delphine alice and manuela made us feel so welcome and were an absolute wealth of information re anything in paris our last stay we opted for a premium room which was wonderful very large quiet and almost felt like having an apartment in the beautiful neighborhood of st germain we will most definitely always stay here when in paris merci beaucoupmy wife and i stayed 6 nights in hotel signature and were quite pleased with the experience  we reserved via internet from the us booking a balcony room on the street side  streets can be noisy in paris but the hotel is on a small street with little traffic and noise wasnt a problem  we visit paris often and probably spend more time than most in our hotel rooms and the balcony room adequate in every other way wasnt big enough for both of us to relax so we moved to a courtyard room larger with a couch and a comfortable chair and my wifes favorite a bathtub  the hotel is in the 7th arrondissement which we like  short walk to blvd st germain a few meters to blvd raspail where there is a great street market 3 times a week  if on business or a tourist in paris forthis hotel is in a wonderful locations lots of good restaurants and fabulous patissieres and the rooms darling and well appointed but tres small  even though the rooms are really small they have added shelving and storage  so very well  the staff is so very welcoming and friendly and helpful  even the shower was quite good compared to many other european showers  our room was in the front and the street is very very quiet even with a school across the street  super close to le bon marche  wonderfuli stayed three nights at hotel signature with my daughter and the service and accommodations were topnotch  i especially appreciated the staff who go out of their way to make you feel at home  the neighborhood is fabulous just walking the streets is a joy  i definitely recommend this hotel as one of the best places to stay in paris,we had booked to stay in another hotel who then emailed me a week prior to our trip to say they would not be open on the day we arrived well they did us a favour because we discovered this absolute gem of a hotel  delphine and the rest of the team were so friendly and welcoming  nothing was too much trouble they booked restaurants for us  advised on covid testing provided a kettle and a corkscrew and were just generally lovely people. our room no 21 was delightful  two huge windows and  a balcony with table and chairs overlooking the street out side the hotel. ai can not say enough good about this hotel but heres an example of how they go above and beyond i had written before i arrived as my flight landed early in the morning and they said theyd note my early arrival and see if my room could be ready for a complimentary early check in.
Hotel Tourisme Avenue,we received excellent service here  the only caveat is the same as for most hotels in paris  there is no parking  the staff were very helpful  the room was extremely clean and comfortable  breakfast was typical and convenient  a short walk to the tower  a metro stop is in front of the hotelconvenient location 15 min walk to eiffel tower  charming european hotel very nice updated rooms and bath  heated towel bar and bidet a plus  helpful staff near metro wonderful chocolate croissants coffee tea available throughout the day  wonderful breakfast of yogurt eggs meats cheeses juice fruit pastrieswe stayed here last year and decided to return as it is very hard to choose a hotel in paris so when we found tourisme avenue we knew we got lucky great service and they endeavoured to get us the same room we had last year as we had loved it special thank you to maxim who was very professional and went the extra mile for us the train is right underneath and gets you all around lots of cafes and restaurants great hotel and we recommend it for paris to save you searchingwe arrived early before our check in time  valerie was there greeting us with a warm welcome before hand she did also helped us arranged airport transportation  responded to our messages very promptly we are so lucky that she even helped us to stay in the same room for our nights because our actual reservation required us to move after the 1st night  rooms are very nice  clean hotel has the best  safe location just 10 minutes away from eiffel tower  the most tasty bakery les gourmandises d eiffel highly recommend this hotel  if we were to travel to paris again we would definitely stay here again for this perfect place  valerie thank u  till we meet again this was my first trip to france and i was traveling solo i wanted to be near the eiffel tower and close to public transportation i chose hotel tourisme avenue for those two reasons  plus price i stayed four nights and was pleased all the way around the hotel did not disappoint the room was clean and well kept the staff were polite approachable and accepting the breakfast buffet was nice a good way to start the day and coffee and croissants were set out in the afternoon there is a small safe in the room the wifi was worked very well there are plenty of restaurants and stores nearby  a starbucks next door there is a laundromat around the block the eiffel tower is just a few minutes walk and if you like to walk and like the adventure the arc de triomphethe hotel was as well kept clean warm and pleasant as last year  the room was attractively decorated and bathroom fixtures of good quality  there is a good choice of fresh food for breakfast and the breakfast room is clean and pleasant  one cant say enough good things about the staff  they are friendly pleasant and go out of their way to be helpful  one couldnt have asked for a better group of people to make the stay in paris pleasantin june 2020 i will be staying here for the 5th time  my son and i come to paris every year to celebrate my birthday and have a great summer trip  i cant bring myself to stay anywhere else  i keep saying i should try something different but i cant because this hotel is that good  the staff is friendly the rooms are clean and quiet and the location can not be beat the metro is literally at the front door  there are many great food options and a grocery store just a minute away  the eiffel tower is a 15 minute walk  best of all i feel safe in this location when i travel with my son  there are hundreds of hotels in paris but hotel tourisme avenue will keep me coming backi recently spent a week at this hotel and i very much appreciated the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff  they went out of their way to ensure i felt at home and every need was satisfied  i asked for a room change after my first night and they were incredibly obliging even sending me a personalized note apologizing for the fact i wasnt 100 satisfied with my original room wow  i wouldnt necessarily advise this hotel for the business traveller although it worked for me  but it seems perfect as a base for a paris tourist  the rooms i tested two were clean and nicely equipped albeit a little small likely the norm in the heart of paris i have stayed in many many hotels in europe and im happy to give these guys a recommendation for their levelwe have visited paris more than 20 times and this is by far the best hotel weve stayed in great room spotlessly clean everything you need good breakfast friendly helpful staff we will be backwe have just stayed at this hotel for 2 nights for my birthday the staff couldnt do anymore to help you the hotel was lovely and clean great value for money the location was perfect for us a few nice eating  drinking places on your doorstep and a gorgeous patisserie on the corner and also right next to the metro which was great for us to travel to various places to sight see would highly recommend this hotel and will certainly go back when in paris in the futurefirst of all the hotel is located 5 min walk from the eiffel tower and two steps from the metro so location really cannot be faulted unless you mind hearing the metro in the nighttime in your room  the reason why i can only give 3 stars is because when we arrived there were ongoing refurbishment work from 9 am every morning monfri right opposite our room the hotel did not inform us of any work being done nor did they offer a different room away from the work if i have to listen to drills and hammers from 9 am with no discountheads up the hotel cannot get a better rating than average the central air conditioning which worked well made a constant noise as most of them do but this noise really got to my head and made me sleep with ear plugs so getting a good nightsthis is a nice medium sized hotel  it is located very close to a metro on three lines fifteen minutes south west of the eiffel tower and in an area with a lot of cafes bars and small restaurants  les invalides was about 20 minutes on foot and arc de triomphe louvre and more are all within an hour walk  but as said the metro offers lots of options  equally important it was just one change on the train from cdg for 10 euros  it has a nice entrance just as well as the receptionist took an age on the phone  but the room was nice decent size with excellent aircon  a shame many of the tv channels were not able to pick up a signal including the bbc news  i dont really watch tv but its nice to have some noise  breakfast was decent with ham cheese pastries andthe staff in the hotel were very friendly and helpful for advice  the hotel was very clean and modern  our junior suite was so much better than expected from the online photos the bed and pillows felt very luxurious my son partner and i all had a great sleep  the location was great and central it was around 8 in a taxi to the eiffel tower and tourist attractions  i would highly recommend this hotel and i would definitely choose this hotel againwe had a good quiet and fully adequatly equiped and clean the room was good airconditioned  and the reception people gave great  service and were very nice and helpfull the hotel is in the vicinity of nice restaurants and of course the eifel toweralso the seine and its nice walking opportunities are close the hotel serves breakfast which we didnt enjoy because we appreciate the coffee of starbucks which is their direct neighbourthe hotel was easy access to public transportation friendly staff  clean it was ideal for a business trip as there are numerous locations for food or drinks and it is a convenient location to walk the hotel rooms are nice and the beds comfortable  for the english speakers the tv even

Hotel de JoBo,i had such an amazing experience at your hotel jobo i accidentally had a small mix up with the dates and in less than a half an hour the staff got me the same room and i was able to get a refund for my mistake the staff was incredibly nice welcoming and helpful i wish i could have stayed longereverything one needs and desires from a parisian stay beautiful neighbourhood excellent

instructions of how you can enjoy paris and the neighbourhood thank you for everything i am definitely coming next year with my whole family we enjoyed our stay at hotel jobo but it felt a little claustrophobic overall tiny elevator tiny corridors and tiny tiny room we only had space to circulate in  out of the roombathroom and around the bed the water temperature in the shower was constantly going a little colder  hotter and we could hear our neighbors a little too well  the staff was impeccable thoughtraveled with my teenage son from prearrival to checkout we received topnotch service the hotel is beautiful  truly parisian with a window that opens overlooking a cobblestone street the location cannot be beat we miss the daily breakfast we cannot wait to returnwe had the most perfect stay at the hotel de jobo aside from the location being perfectly situated in the marais and near the metro the service rooms and everything about it  people food decor water pressure romance  was better than anything weve experienced on a trip in a long time the help from catherine and the others at the front from making reservations obtaining ticket passes etc far surpassed expectations and their advice was tailored to our tastes not to arrangements they have with certain restaurants etci recently traveled through europe with my boyfriend and this was our first stop of the tripwhat a wonderful welcome to the continent it was started off with a surprise delivery of roses from my boyfriend which the hotel coordinated for him and continued with constant kindness and helpfulness from hotel staff   they were some of the most polite and kind people ive ever metfrom greeting us with complementary lattes upon arrival to printing out travel documents on the day of our departure they made every effort to make our stay a wonderful onejust had a couple of nights stay in paris  with my daughter jobo is in a great location with fantastic faultless service considering the quality and location it was good value for money we will definitely returngreat hotel beautifully decorated staff was very professional and helpful helped book moulin rogue tickets  a van to airport great

ever paris trip from aug 6 to aug 9 of 2021 we dont have enough words to express our appreciation everyone can talk about great location and beautiful decor but i would like to stress upon unbelievably awesome warm welcome and service provided by cyril catherine gaston and others apologize for not remembering all names this team is amazing  they not only guided us through the map of paris but provided fantastic food and shopping recommendations we were greeted with the same warmth and smiling faces at early morning or midnight they truly made our stay memorable if we ever come back to paris again the hotel de jobo is the place we are stayingwe moved to this hotel from another hotel and were so glad we did decent sized rooms beautiful decor larger bathrooms and gracious hotel staff hotel was also in excellent location to metro and restaurants only negative was that uber drivers had a hard time finding it but we mostly used metro stations that were 3 and 7 minutes away great shops nearby for morning breakfastour stay was just delightful i mainly chose the hotel because of the unique decor and location both were perfect as was the overall service and pleasant atmosphere this was really one of the best hotels stays ive had so many details have been thought of and the staff couldnt have been nicer or more helpfulif i ever have the fortune of visiting paris again i will return to hotel de jobo everything was perfect my sister and i stayed in single rooms both were clean comfortable and quiet the shower was great and with high temps in the 80s we especially appreciated a well airconditioned room the location was perfect cafes bars restaurants shops bakeries etc were all within steps of the hotel i honestly cant say enough good things about the hotel and area thank you for making our trip memorablebeautiful little hotel loved the dcor and feel like i havent seen it anywhere else  the staff were very warm and friendly especially the manager the evening of august 26 im sorry i didnt get his name  loved having a coffee maker in the room  i will definitely stay here again the next time i visit pariswell located hotel in le marais which is

friendly helpful staff  resident golden retriever  a really really wonderful experience staying here  highly recommend to anyone coming to paris my wife and i stayed here on the third and final leg of our trip to europe i had never really stayed at a boutique hotel and wasnt too keen on the idea but my wife was insistent that she wanted to stay here so i conceded i am very glad that i did  the hotel is listed as a 3 star property but it was far nicer than the 4 star property we were coming from in rome extremely charming clean great location and just had an overall cozy feel    personally when i stay at a hotel there are 3 main aspects that are make or break for me  1 cleanliness  very clean no complaints whatsoever  2 bed  solid again no complaints  3 3 showerbathroom  amazing  spacious nice toiletries  finally the real aspect that made this a truly memorable stay was the staff very helpfulmy first stay was for two nights and i thoroughly looked forward to the second visit a few days later one could not hope to meet a more congenial group of hosts anxious to make it the best possible the rooms were indeed cozy poets corners but they were absolutely perfect the location made a couple of visits to the eiffel tour as convenient as could bethe rooms were tiny and theres not much in terms of a view but the breakfast every morning was fantastic with cheese bread and cold meats its hard to beat the location which is just a street over from the eiffel towerthe hotel is located in a wonderful part of paris in the seventh arr where you are close to the eiffel tower but still feel the genuine feeling of a bustling residential area with many restaurants to choose from the hotel is also perfectly located for excursions to many of the things to see in paris  the room we stayed in is very clean and calm facing the inner courtyard plenty of space for two guests and a big dog the room has a good safe with plenty of space for laptops etc and the bathroom is very fresh the hotel staff are all very friendly and always asking if you need anything so you feel very welcome there is a luggage storage rom we will definitely come back to stay herei booked an impromptu

experience from check in when we arrived early and tired and were immediately given our room keys two rooms for my wife and three adult children  a wonderful warm welcome totally relaxed to the really chilled atmosphere to the perfect location nestled in small parisian streets with terrific restaurants pattisieres located within a few hundred metres of the eiffel tower to the gorgeous breakfasts when we would be chatted to by whoever was on to the beautiful quaint rooms to the really comfortable beds to the terrific advice as to what restaurants to go to to the really professional concierge service to the day before leaving checkout because we had early morning flights this hotel is aperfect boutique hotel for a paris getaway  my husband and i came to paris for the weekend and wanted a quaint quiet beautiful hotel  and that is just what we got  its just a short walk to the eiffel tower so we enjoyed waking there at night and relaxing on the lawn the hotel was very clean and the rooms were beautifully decorated  the staff was very friendly and knew us by first name instantly  they always greeted us and were helpful in recommending places to eat shops transportation etc their breakfast was delicious too  i would definitely recommend and we would love to stay here again at our next paris visitrooms were clean with a nice view over the rooftops of paris the room was not very big but fair considered what we pay for breakfast was good too recommended if you dont want to spend a fortune in paristhe londres eiffel an authentically local and well managed boutique hotel is well worth a stay especially for those exploring the left banks many outstanding attractions during our early december visit the management and staff were extraordinarily courtesy and helpful as we navigated the finer points of this worldclass city our 2nd floor room was a step up from the standard  albeit a bit cozy though not atypical of its class  it was nonetheless clean and comfortable with two functioning windows allowing for a bit of fresh air not to be missed is samba a golden retriever and the the londres mascot seen lounging most days in the front sitting area   located in the 7th arrondissment of paris the londres is literally steps from the corner of rue saint dominque whereeverything about this hotel was superb  booking in was easy we were warmly welcomed and given lots of information about the hotel and surrounding area including a list of what turned out to be superb local restaurants local being within a 5 minute walk  all the staff that we met were helpful and charming  our room was small  we expected this but it was so well designed that it was absolutely not an issue  we had everything that we needed  the shower was great and the loccitane supplies added a little luxury  wonderful to have proper soap  despite overlooking the street there was very little night time noise and that with the very comfortable bed meant that we slept very well  breakfast was simple but of a very high quality  superb croissants  any informationthe highlight of the hotel is the friendly helpful staff who go out of their way to assist you with anything you might need   we arrived early on the first day of our stay and were able to check in as soon as we got there  this was great after an overnight flight from the us  each person there whether working at the desk or cleaning the room brought their own style of friendliness and helpfulness  when we checked out we were waiting for the cab to the airport when the housekeeper came down to us to return a phone charger we had left behind  the hotel is in a nice location in easy walking distance to the eiffel tower numerous restaurants and other attractions but it is the staff that make the differencewe have just returned from a threenight stay at the hotel de londres eiffel   from the moment we walked through the door we were treated to fantastic oldworld charm and hospitality every one of the team at the hotel were kind thoughtful and happy to answer all of our questions the hotel is tucked away down a side street but only minutes walk from the eiffel tower and other local attractions such as the musee branly and les invalides the hotel rooms are all stylish and peaceful and the breakfast is lavish and tasty the public rooms are also beautifully decorated and there are lots of books on local subjects in the dining room and entrance if you are lucky you will get to meet the hotel mascot samba an equally friendly golden retriever  we can see why this hotel is,i booked an impromptu trip to paris from the netherlands with my baby daisy a large  fox houndlab mix  all i have to say is that we were both treated like princesses by the staff at hotel de londres. i stayed on the 6th floor in a room with a view of the tower and it couldnt have been a better room even the shower had a tower view. my favorite restaurant les cocottes is just around the corner also there are huge areas of grass parks for your fur baby  we will always stay here from now on.
Hotel du Triangle d'Or,this hotel is your best bet for a budget stay in paris the staff is very nice helpful and professional the hotel is really cute its centered around music and all the rooms are tastefully decorated following this theme without going overboard the rooms are quite small but its the norm in paris clean and comfortable the location is really what makes this hotel stand out there are grocery stores stores zara massimo dutti etc restaurants bakeries and bars in the same block galeries lafayette le printemps and lopra de paris are within walking distance the area is really safe and fun i have to mention the adult shops some of the rooms have a view on them it wasnt a problem for us there was nothing shocking however you might want to think about it ifi dont like so much this hotel the room was clean but very small without a kettle and smell not good i dont like the pillowvery inconfortabilethe breakfast was very poor just some bread jamyoghurtcofee some sour bacon and eggsif you asked for altough the location was very convenient and staff very friendlythis hotel deserves more than its 3 star rating the staff are fantastic the rooms are nicely decorated with great bathrooms its city centre location just adds to its appeal close to lots of theatres and concert venues place de la concrde is a 10 minute walk metro station is close by as is a a bus that takes you to charles de gaulle airporti had a small hiccup when i checked in to the hotel but the staff immediately made sure that i felt as if nothing had happened very warm staff and extremely supportive i dare say a 5 star hotel service  i recommend this hotel for business or leisurespent three nights in the quirky boutique hotel was a bit worried at first as the road didnt appear very appealing however couldnt have wished for morelocation fantastic decor super cool spotlessly clean  maid service every day with fresh linen and towels will definitely go back again one tiny negative which is why i didnt give 5 stars breakfast was very nice but not in abundancei had a very nice experience in the hotelshe is in an ideal close to all location next to madeleine place with metro at 150m from the hotelthe room was very modern decorated and cleanstuff was very friendly and helpfulwill be my first choice when i visit paris next timestaff were charming helpful and kind the decor was chic interesting and quirky but the rooms are sparse and small worse than that my room had the smallest bed i have ever slept in  im 63 and my legs were about 1 12 feet over the end when i like down  i thought it was for a childs bed what made itbworse was the plastic under sheet    i didnt sleep at all  combine this with cheap amenities thin cheap towels 1 only and one small shampoo  sad because ive stayed in most of the business hotels in that area of paris now and this is my worst experiencethis hotel is super cute the decoration is so cool it seems it is newly renovated room was clean the location is perfect it is near shops and cafes 1 min away from madeleine train station i would highly recomend this hotel even for people on vacationwe were caught up having to book a last minute hotel in paris for a night  this hotel was affordable compared to other properties so we went with it  the front desk staff was welcoming and were happy to assist us in english the hotel is in a location where it seems like youre a nice walk from some great spots like montmartre this little hotel is perfectly located for the roissy bus if you are arriving at or leaving from cdg it is also well located for many sights eating places etc in paris and only a 10 15 min walk to an excellent laundromat the hotel is clean and the room comfortable with all that you need as the room was ready when i arrived they were happy for me to go into it a few hours early staff were friendly especially  fatima who was extremely friendly and helpful  if you can book well in advance you may get a very good ratestayed a short night at the hotel in july with my family and loved the hotel great deco super clean lovely room and most of all super friendly staff which is so enjoyable  thank you very much for a lovely stayvery nice hotel excellent location in the center of paris at a very affordable price  friendly staff modern rooms quite big to paris standards  i cant but recommend this place  ill be back and also great  theres a pret  manger just around the corner so no need to take breakfast in the hotel this hotel was recommended by our travel agency and im very glad they did loved the location which is perfect for shopping and going out the hotel is nice very differently decorated but is perfectly functional theres good free wifi throughout and the staff is very friendly breakfast is ok nothing special just a first instalment before you hit the town for coffee  croissantsstayed 6 nights there the location is good and staffs of reception were very nice however the man who servers breakfast was rude very unpleasant experience having breakfast there except for the breakfast is a good hotel stillyou can hop on a roissybus from cdg airport t2 to reach opera directly for euro 12 per pax and its only 600m walk to the hotel 6 mins so its much better than taking metro as the steps at the various stations one needs to change will kill you if you have heavy luggages there are 3 choices of metro stations that you can go madeleine being the nearest we actually walked to louvre on day of arrival after checking in printemps grand lafayette is also very near our room was reasonable in size with room enough to place and open a luggage bag without blocking any passages very clean and they made the beds every day  staff ms fatimah and mr shah were both very friendly and helpful helped us made dinner reservation as our french is limited to bonjour and merci only wethis hotel has a funky music vibe to it with some interesting design elements a lively vibe there was a music theme in my room with a drum as a side table and a amp  roadie case as my wardrobe staff was great and helpful and location was great  my only two negatives  breakfast was expensive and not worth the charge plenty of cafes nearby second the shower glass is a design flaw the glass is short and no matter how hard i tried i sprayed water on the floor  id still choose the hotel againthis was a great little find i stayed for 2 nights on a break with friends the hotel is situated only 5 minutes from the river close to the jardin des tuileries a 1 minute walk to a metro station and the hop on hop off bus stop the staff were super friendly and the rooms were bright and clean and really well decorated the only downside was that the hotel didnt have a bar but there are plenty of places to eat and drink nearby highly recommendedi used the hotel many times in the past but was shocked to see there was no free water in the room and a shocking breakfast served  eggs were pre boiled and not hot gluten free bread means eating crackers fruit salad was some pieces of pineapple left over in a soup but most shockingly everything is packed in plastic i add a photo to see how much plastic waste i produced with just one person cheese butter sugar tea bag etc all packed in single portions and the shower towels are too small this is 19th century hotellerie sustainability is key overall disappointed although location is perfect love the concept and rooms and service at reception wonderfulas they say location location location   triangle dor is a shortwalkdistance from the louvre a

returngreat little boutique hotel we found using secret escapes and was good walking distance from several monuments  shopping  dining staff were very friendly helpful and accommodating we had separate rooms for the kids on the same floor just around the corner provided privacy and ease of access when we wanted to check in on them there a couple monopole convenient stores nearby wine water etc we walked to the louvre 15 min and several other attractions 1530 min  found some great boutiques for clothing nearby and plenty of decent restaurants within 515 min walk or uber also underground station was a 5 min walkwe booked this hotel for just one night before flying home the next morning  it wasnt bad just not as exceptional as other small similarly priced hotels in paris  positives included a helpful front desk clean and modern facilities good location quiet rooms  negatives were an amazingly hard bed  i like firm beds but this was beyond that  an air conditioning system that was hard to control and blew air directly in your face all night a not unusual small inadequate glass shield only partly blocking the shower from spraying all over the bathroom  many people would find this ok but its not hard to do better for the same pricestaff concierge and services were great it does have a small elevator but its new and not meant for a football team breakfast had excellent

Hotel la Nouvelle Republique,an excellent hotel in paris with excellent service and great people to take care of all your needs familywise and for personal trips comfort is ensured in a quiet environment near metro stations and a lively neighbourhoodbesides a perfect bed a very nice room a stylish interior the cherry on the cake was the warm welcome we received from the owner and her staff we will certainly come back when we will visit paris againmy wife and i were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary in paris for the week and plans to visit our daughter in berlin the next week we searched everywhere for a hotel near restaurants the metro and live music this hotel is all those things and more nearby restaurant metro just down the street and a pub with live music right on the corner the room was clean bathroom and shower were great and a view of the street without much noise we loved our room with a king bed which i was told we wouldnt be able to find at a reasonable price the free breakfast was outstanding and the staff was friendly helpful and knowledgeable we couldnt of dreamed of a better experience unfortunately due to covid19 we were forced to cut our stay short we didnt get to see ourcovid is total respect and coffee and tea are nonstop available the place is cosy and beautiful first of all i was amazed by the choice of design decoration and taste i recommend highly this place for a stay the staff is always helpful and friendlyit begins with the staff  it doesnt matter how nice a hotel is if the staff is rude and unaccommodating the experience goes down the drain  we spent two full weeks in europe during the height of covid19  break out we are americans  the staff went out of their way with ever changing demands to make sure we were taken care of  everything from staying on hold with airlines for 40 minutes to working with us at 3 in the morning to help us get a ride to the airport when our flight changed last minute  the staff was and is the best  then comes the room  while small as can be expected in big city hotels they were comfortable  our out door balcony was beautiful and private the rooms clean and cozy and their commitment to sustainability was above all the cherry on topwe just stayed at this hotel for a quick weekend trip to paris   the staff is very nice and the rooms clean and quiet we had the joy of being upgraded to a larger room which was a nice surprise   the breakfast is not large but has all the things you need and the most yummy cheese and sourdough bread coffee and tea is free all day in the lounge which is super nice to hang out in   super markets and metros are close by   we will definetely come back herewe stayed for one night in a room with 3 separate beds on the first floor our room had its own garden couryard area the room was fine and beds were comfortable the hotel is in an unpolished part of paris but only 5mins from metro station it is also easy to walk into city centre towards the marais the hotel offers free tea and coffee in the reception room on the ground floor where breakfast is served we found the staff to be friendly and helpful would certainly consider returningannounced as a quirky vintage hotel but rather an average execution of it the lobby looked rather shabby instead of trendy with a disorganized welcome desk at the entrance it that sense it is overrated on this site or other review sites  rooms definitely not spotless with greasy hand and fingerprints on tv screen bed door windows etc the lovely little terrace of room 11 was simply not cleaned for a long long time sheets etc were ok but with carpet on the floor i am not sure how tidy it was in general  breakfast was ok but at 9h30 they ran out of stuff yoghurts baguette saying sorry its sunday  bread or croissants werent fresh but frozen stuff knowing you are in paris this is disappointing  staff was friendly though and rooms quiet beds rather hard andthis little hotel is perfect great location close to republique le marais but also the vibrant life of its own neighborhood the staff is great so helpful  my room was spacious with a beautiful little patio so you can sit outside too bad it was winter breakfast is very complete and the possibility to get coffeetea  for free all day is great the lobbyrestaurant area is a perfect location to work as well and meet i will defnitely come backafter two years of being unable to visit paris i was finally able to return and there was no hesitating a full two week stay at la nouvelle republique the staff was as kind and helpful as ever day or night i had a problem with wifi service in my room and they did not hesitate to loan me a hotspot for my entire stay  no charge   the breakfast was as good as the previous visit dont let the boisterous rue oberkampf fool you the hotel is on a side street with nearly soundproof windows the heated floor in the bathroom was an unexpected delight towards the end of my visit friends from lisbon joined me and have the same opinion  love the cat who lives in the lobby chic unpretentious and as one says in french a vaux le valeurso comfortable the room was exactly as pictured and very clean the small details were really appreciated like the books and water in the room the staff was nice and the hotel secure it was also on a quiet side street so it was very peaceful highly recommendreally stylish boutique hotel in a great authentic area of paris surrounded by cool bars and restaurants nice touches such as usb ports uk sockets and tablet so you can log into your netflix and prime accounts  lovely continental breakfast with unlimited hot drinks in stylish yet comfortable barrestaurant best thing for us though was the friendly staff and owner who made us feel very welcome and helpful best hotel weve stayed in in europe for a long timetheres always someone around to offer a welcoming greeting whatever time we stepped through the door  the hotel seems to owned by a black and white cat called socrates who shows little to no interest in guests but will tolerate a ear scratch or two  we were issued a key card each to let yourself into the  hotel and to your room i hate hotels where you have to wait to be let in by someone late at night also hotels where they only give you one key so that you have to be joined at the hip  room designed by someone who travels plenty of usb ports reasonable amount of storage reading lights etcetc clean and spacious plus a nice little touch of an old typewriter with a welcome message in it bed was soft in nature which will suit some and not others they also provide anwe loved to stay there rooms are very stylish and clean bed was comfortable and we missed nothing staff was very nice and helpful we came by car and they helped with the parking answered to several emails quickly neighbourhood is full of cool bars and restaurants so we liked to spend time there would definitely recommend we hope to come back  concerning covid they were very cautious and well prepared we felt really safe therethis is a very small and quaint hotel with good breakfast and excellent service the employees in particular were really wonderful and made our stay a lovely experience this is not in the city center but there are a couple of subway stations nearby all about a less than 10 minute walk the rooms would be cleaned every day and were always left absolutely spotless   my only complaint would be the wifi from our room it was very weak and took forever to load anythingafter two years of being unable to visit paris i was finally able to return and there was no hesitating a full two week stay at la nouvelle republique the staff was as kind and helpful as ever day or night i had a problem with wifi

access to airportaverage hotel 35 not sure why this gets such raving reviews  the room has funky decor it may be to your taste or it may not bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet our room had no view at all just a claustrophobic courtyard  the elevator is the tiniest thing i have seen yet in paris plan on one person wluggage or two witnout if you have a big suitcase i doubt it will fit unless you send it up by itself  breakfast here is a definitely a miss and the street the hotel is on is a little sketch not the most interesting or convenient neighborhood either unless you have specific business here which we did  1 star as ryan at the front desk was very friendly and accommodating thank you ryanhow describe  in 200 characters what can be summarized in a few words  welcome smile decoration nice music very good restaurant king of breakfast very good bedding nice neighborhood  really a superb addressi chose this hotel for a short solo trip to paris the hotel is centrally

woman travelling solo i felt super comfortable at the hotel highly recommend staying here so grateful i had such a wonderful experience i will definitely be coming backthis is a cute 3 star hotel in a not so touristy section of paris i had actually booked this hotel for that reason and i was not disappointed     the hotel itself is on a side street that is not busy which makes it wonderfully quiet in the evening when youre ready to sleep  it has a very small but inviting reception area the most inviting part of which is actually the management   and by management i mean ijlal jarid   she runs this boutique hotel as if it were her own largish bed and breakfast   with a huge smile and a delightful character there seems to be nothing that is out of the way for her to do for her guests   she is a jewel  my room 12 which is on the street was quiet smallish one gets smallish rooms in paris and well equipped with plenty of lightingcool hotel in an interesting area lots of bars and restaurants nearby its nofrills but great value for money ask for a room overlooking the street the rooms at the back overlooking the courtyard are very darkthis is a cute 3 star hotel in a not so

helpful best hotel weve stayed in in europe for a long timei stayed here for 3 days in september as part of a solo birthday trip for my 30th i had booked a triple since i had anticipated friends joining but it ended up just being me given covid travel logistics i felt very safe walking around the area even at night though common sense says to stick to main roads i do live in a city in the us but i liked being somewhere that seemed like it was true parisians and not just other tourists there are multiple metro stations close to the hotel and as it was my first time in paris all of the tourist sites were never more than a 20 minute metro ride away tops i think i used rue st maurbelleville the most but also walked past couronnes and parmentier in my explorations   the roombed was very comfortable and i loved the smella jewel in the centre of paris a beautiful place very well located excellent breakfast the most important was the staff  very attentive warm and helpful we wont forget the champagne and we are definitely coming back,an excellent hotel in paris with excellent service and great people to take care of all your needs familywise and for personal trips comfort is ensured in a quiet environment near metro stations and a lively neighbourhood. Besides a perfect bed a very nice room a stylish interior the cherry on the cake was the warm welcome we received from the owner and her staff. coffee and tea are nonstop available the place is cosy and beautiful.
Hotel le Notre Dame,we found the hotel well managed with clean room and a sufficient bathroom it was very quietdespite its proximity to metro rer and the seine you could enjoy the view of notre dame when you had your good petit dejeuner an excellent choice for a few nightsgreat service little gifts were provided by the management making my experience all the more special  beautiful view of the notre dame tucked away in a little corner by the train station this was a perfect little home base in parislocation good  view good  room miniscule  elevator  tiny but i think its substandard because it barely works good luck  this is the dumbest thing i have ever seen in my life  i have to leave my room key at the front desk every time i step outside  and pick it up when i come in  damn im almost 50 years old and have traveled the world my whole life  i have never seen this stupid absurd and ridiculous policy anyyyyy where  why is it bad  let me tell you why  because it takes time to drop off the room key or pick it up every time  because if theres someone at the front desk i wont interrupt them naturally because im cultured  or if the front desk person is on the phone i wont interrupt them naturally  or if they are in the back late nightin the year since my first visit to paris the yellowjacketed protestors have stormed the champselyse and a fire severely damaged the notre dame cathedral but the memories of my stay across the river from that landmark are still fresh in my mind the wonderful staff at this small but meticulously maintained hotel at a busy intersection cheerfully greeted me each day and my small but wellappointed corner room provided an incredible view of all that went on outside and below i quickly adjusted as well to the small bathroom that was similar to what ive experienced during my couple of other trips to europe a comfortable setting in a great location was a winning combinationlocation good  view good  room miniscule  elevator  tiny but i think its substandard because it barely works good luck  this is the dumbest thing i have ever seen in my life  i have to leave my room key at the front desk every time i step outside  and pick

person is on the phone i wont interrupt them naturally  or if they are in the back late nightmy husband and i stayed here for our first trip to paris the location is fantastic a short walk to the metro station and overlooks beautiful notre dame cathedral the latin quarter area holds all sorts of great places for live music and food as well the staff were great and helped with any recommendations needed the room was amazing  we stayed on the top floor with a split level room that was well stocked and maintained throughout our visit i highly recommend this hotel for any occasionthis is my favorite hotel in paris have stayed there 6 times nowand always recommend it to friends there is no better view of the notre dame cathedral near to many bars and restaurants and it is right on the seine the rooms are each so wonderfully decorated each different and unique  staff and security are excellent as welli stayed here in late february for 4 nights and the experience was fantastic  the rooms are unique and lovely the staff always ready to help and the history of the place was a great touch  local area could not be better for wandering the streets bakeries and cafes  highly recommend this place especially for couplesthe location is great the rooms are not so great   if you are at all claustrophobic this place isnt for you the elevator is old small and creaky the hallways are miniature and the rooms are small the bathrooms are very small  the location is perfect the entrance easy to miss and the breakfast is very nice but i love french breads and butter  the staff is attentive  but this hotel has the ugliest and most horrific carpeting and wallpaper i have ever seen the designer should be spankedspecial location with a very special atmosphere and on very good located the room and the respective view out of it in direction notre dame is spectacular they are really good organized and offer a good standingmy husband and i stayed here for our first trip

highly recommend this hotel for any occasionspecial location with a very special atmosphere and on very good located the room and the respective view out of it in direction notre dame is spectacular they are really good organized and offer a good standingbooked a long weekend in paris and browsed numerous similar looking hotels before finding hotel notre dame st michel unique design interior and location overlooking notre dame the seine and shakespeare and company shop and cafe sold us there are a warren of streets nearby containing numerous fine bars and restaurants you are never far from a restaurant and a ten minute stroll to the louvre sorbonne rue de rivoli etc rooms are decent size by parisien standards but the staff are superb couldnt have been friendlier and more helpful first time i have had than made up for it great stay we will definitely returnwonderful hotel fantastic location and the best staff in the world thanks very much for making my time in paris so enjoyable  i would recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting paris and want a central location the view of notre dame is unforgettablewe got lucky our room had direct view on notre dame the room and hotel decor is amazing breakfast was also really good we had a perfect time in the heart of paris we really enjoyed our stay thank youwe booked our last night in paris after time in switzerland  unfortunately the general transportation strike made it not likely that we could get to the hotel andmore importantly from the hotel to the airport the next morning to fly home  this meant we needed to cancel our reservation and stay at the airport which is what we did  the staff at the notre dame could not have been more generous and prompt with their help in accomplishing this for us  this is why i am writing this review and also why i will look forward to actually staying there on our next paris trip  very helpful staffthis hotel has a wonderful location just steps from a metro stop and within walking distance of many major sights  the service is perfect here 24 hour bar service clean rooms knowledgeable and helpful staff and close to lots of left bank cafes  they provide all the usual concierge support and the french breakfast  features the best croissants i have had  the oj is fresh squeezed  the decor is rather  quirky but then why do we go to paris after allhotel is wonderful  there is 1 flight of stairs to the front desk  and a 1 person  2 bags tiny elevator other then that hotel room was lovely and the city views incredible of notre dame amazing simple breakfast was perfect coffee and croissant staff  members were nice and helpful again location was everything 7 minutes from anyplace and hop on hope off bus outside your hotel just wonderful experiencea very last minute booking and so glad  our room looked over the seine with notre dame to the right  on the left bank so many many places to eat  pauls a 5 minute walk and a grocery store just beyond it  subway and rer just down the street  interesting decor by christian lacoix see picture of stairs  the staff were open friendly and helpful caveatour room did not have a true shower  not sure about other rooms but be aware if that is important to youi wanna take a few minutes to mention how much we enjoyed staying at your place to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary last week the place was very clean and cozy and located next to some of the most important sightseeing locations in paris   everybody that worked at the hotel was very friendly accommodating courteous and helpful  this was mine and my wifes first trip to paris and hopefully not our last  sincerely steve  oksana heckscheryou cant beat the location i wanted somewhere central for my father who is 75 so we didnt have to faff with travel very easy to get from eurostars gare de nord one stop on the blue line and you come out 2 minutes walk away you can walk to notre dame louvre the seine river cruise pick up points next to shakespeare and co  maddest bookshop ever theres cafes and restaurants galore on your door stop we ubered to monmartre and moulin rouge  the hotel staff are very nice and very helpful  the rooms are quite fun but a bit tired the hairdryer didnt work it was replaced very quickly but still didnt work in the full setting there was silver fish in the bath there is no shower curtain in the bath the courtyard view is most definitely not a courtyard just airlift and laundry the hotel summary and list of facilities includes a lift and self service laundry  there is no laundry  the hotel reception is on the first floor up a steep staircase with narrow treads and a bend at the top the lift only goes up from the reception level if you are not young and fit or have small lite bags the stairs are quite dangerous there is no porter or help available the only reference to the stairs is in the hotels policy statement regarding lack of wheel chair access stating that reception is only accessible by stairs no mention of reception being one flight up there is a caution to call the hotel if you have difficulty with stairs we took this to be directed to people with a disability the lift itself is very small we needed two trips toabsolutely loved this place the staff was very welcoming and helpful and the atmosphere was relaxing yet fun i stayed here two nights and loved all of it its in walking distance of anything you could want or need and nearby lots of great sites to go see if you have a short trip and want to see a lot i would definitely recommend staying here the staff are incredible and so helpfulaccommodation was in a perfect location the room was generous and the linen towels and sheets were lush we really enjoyed our stay here and enjoyed our breakfast each day we would highly recommend staying herethis is my favorite hotel in paris have stayed there 6 times nowand always recommend it to friends there is no better view of the notre dame cathedral near to many bars and restaurants and it is right on the seine the rooms are each so wonderfully decorated each different and unique  staff and security are excellent as welli stayed here in late february for 4 nights and the experience was fantastic  the rooms are unique and lovely the staff always ready to help and the history of the place was a great touch  local area could not be better for wandering the streets bakeries and cafes  highly recommend this place especially for couplesconveniating location close to notre dame metro and rer station overall a very nice hotel in paris as previuos reviewers has mentioned therese are no lift up to the first floor where reception is and no wall handle for the shower breakfast is light french coffee juice and bread so if you want more than that therese are pleanty of restaurants around the corner instead no fridge or water nice personnel and check in and check out very smooth would stay here againgreat location and nice views of seine and notre dame room a bit small but clean and comfortable reception is up a flight of stairs but reception 24 hour great spot for pubs and restaurants and walking along rive gauchesituated strategically diagonally across from notre dame this hotel affords convenience and calm  the room was generous and spotless  the hotel staff was courteous efficient and friendly  i sill stay againchose this hotel for our first night in paris mainly for the convenient location  we were arriving after a very long flight so wanted a place easy to get to  preferably a straight shot on the airport train from cdg with no transfer and close to the station  this hotel totally met these requirements  its right across the street from the nearest exit there are quite a few exits for this stop stmichel notredame  be sure to follow signs for norte dame  the hotel is right on the corner checkinlobby on second  so will have to lug any baggage up a flight of narrow stairs from the street entrance  from the lobby there is a shoebox sized elevator  just enough for 2 people or 2 suitcases but not all together room we booked was double with view of river or notre dame,we found the hotel well managed with clean room and a sufficient bathroom it was very quiet. despite its proximity to metro rer and the seine you could enjoy the view of notre dame when you had your good petit dejeuner an excellent choice for a few nightsgreat service little gifts were provided by the management making my experience all the more special. i have to leave my room key at the front desk every time i step outside  and pick it up when i come in  damn im almost 50 years old and have traveled the world my whole life  I have never seen this stupid absurd and ridiculous policy.
Ibis Styles Paris Meteor Avenue d'Italie,the hotel staff is very friendly and the hotel is super clean and great decoration in the breakfast area we truly enjoyed our stay we stayed there for 4 days and had a great time breakfast is very fresh and great croissantsgreatly located next to a lot of public transport stations one minute to the bus station and two minutes to the metro and tram stations but also next to some bistros and markets ibis styles meteor offered us a quiet stay for 4 nights in paris even though we arrived a few hours before checkin time the young lady at the front desk was very open and took our backpacks and trollers back so we could go down to a bistro nearby to eat and to drink a cold beer at 1400 the room was waiting for us clean and cool only good for a short rest before taking the trocadero and climbing the eiffel tower breakfast is ok except the option to boil your own eggs in a small dedicated kettle at one point there was a queue to boil an egg  the staff was exemplary both at the receptioni enjoyed my 4 night stay at this hotel it was clean and comfy it was easy to access metro line 7 and get to the city center however what i disliked was the weird boil your own eggs thing at breakfast i have never heard or seen this at any hotel it was a mess one morning i put two eggs to boil and when i came back a couple minutes later the eggs were gone lol also i think there was a lack of fruit and vegetable optionsthe hotel staff is very friendly and the hotel is super clean and great decoration in the breakfast area we truly enjoyed our stay we stayed there for 4 days and had a great time breakfast is very fresh and great croissantsstaff were super friendly and available you would really feel welcome by the team the room design was really pleasant spacious functional and comfortable i would definitely recommend this hotel and i will come back for sureit is my sixth visit to paris and this hotel exceeded my expectations it is close to everywhere very clean and the employees are very professional and friendly they can always help the breakfast was also very goodquality price is very good location not finished and even damaged parts in room  there were bootle parts and socks under the bed so not cleaned properly light was falling out of holding medial treatment dismooved from room 20the hotel is not fully done yet to much dust smell etc i had allergy all the time of my stayingthe night manager was too rude the girlday manager was helpful breakfast is ok  location  far from center looks dangerous but metro station is in 2 min walknice hotel as expected  good location near subway the room is a bite tiny clean and not loudness i regret only the reception there is no desk it is a open space you dont know exactly who is charged for the checking  and the private parking was not yet available compare to the websitewe stayed 5 nights the hotel is brand new 150 meters from metro station line 7 and from supermarkets the staff was very polite and helpful the neighborhood has some restaurants and cafes the continental breakfast was greati enjoyed my 4 night stay at this hotel it was clean and comfy it was easy to access metro line 7 and get to the city center however what i disliked was the weird boil your own eggs thing at breakfast i have never heard or seen this at any hotel it was a mess one morning i put two eggs to boil and when i came back a couple minutes later the eggs were gone lol also i think there was a lack of fruit and vegetable optionsthis hotel had only been open a couple of months when we visited so everything was brand new the rooms were clean and of a good size for a place to crash after a day of sightseeing in paris   its towards the end of the metro line but that means its nice and quiet in the area and the metro station is a very short distance away from the hotel   the breakfast is included in the price and was a good basic selection of continental breakfast items there is also free coffee and tea at the entrance to the hotel for guests to take away with them   i would return to this hotel againthis hotel is a good property for the daily price   room cleaned daily breakfast was included and short walk to convenient metro line   downside is little to no desk area no business center we ran out of bath soap in the room and staff didnt notice for 3 days luckily we had also brought our own  no iron and minimal amenities maybe consistent with daily price   this hotel was included in our paris package so we didnt really choose it  however after a hard day of sightseeing it was quiet comfortable and cleanhotel is still work in progress especially outside location good right next to subway station room is spacious and brand new sparsely decorated toilet  shower area is good design breakfast has lots of selectionfirst close to bus and metro stations many restaurants and stores all are within short distance of walking a lot of choices to decide second at the time of my stay the room price was super great for paris other places charged two or three times higher than this one third the place was new and just opened with small quiet comfortable room and wifi fourth was the free great breakfast with plenty of choices observed majority of french people staying there i will stay there in future recommend great value for close to paris with easy accessi was with my wife for a short tripp from 2629 september 2019the hotel is new the staff is very friendlythe breakfast is a good onethe towels can be changed any timeif you put them in the shower cabinthe room is nice the bed very comftableif it will be a small fridgeit will be betteryou have air conditioning and you can choose the temperature you wantdo not search for a regular receptionthere are some young ladies wich are doing the reception jobthey are very kind and speak a beautiful english so it will be no problem of communicationwe had a great help from miss nana and i want to thank  her personallyfor sure we shall come backgreatly located next to a lot of public transport stations one minute to the bus station and two minutes to the metro and tram stations but also next to some bistros and markets ibis styles meteor offered us a quiet stay for 4 nights in paris even though we arrived a few hours before checkin time the young lady at the front desk was very open and took our backpacks and trollers back so we could go down to a bistro nearby to eat and to drink a cold beer at 1400 the room was waiting for us clean and cool only good for a short rest before taking the trocadero and climbing the eiffel tower breakfast is ok except the option to boil your own eggs in a small dedicated kettle at one point there was a queue to boil an egg  the staff was exemplary both at the receptionas someone else mentioned this is the 2nd day weve had housekeeping come into our room unannounced  today i asked her to leave but she doesnt speak english so she huffed and puffed and rolled her eyes because we stayed in the room  then she came back 10 minutes later and just entered again without knocking  unacceptable the construction outside is so loud we cannot keep our window open the motion sensor in the stairwell doesnt come on right away and has once shut back off while we were still on the stairs  thats downright dangerous as someone else mentioned we had 2 bottles of water on the desk when we arrived but no refills since breakfast here is pointless  its disorganized poorly stocked dirty and its just basics like cheese and lunchmeat yogurt breadclean hotel friendly staff various breakfast tea coffee hot chocolate and fruit for free throughout the day near to the metro 150 m from porte ditalie station  line 7 so easy to explore paris for our group it was perfect for sure we shall come backits a nice brand new hotel breakfast was good different setup no actual huge checkin reception area but always someone at the entrance to help if you have any questions i like the fact it was on the 12 line which stop at many attractions opera louvre etcvery very new rooms were on the small side but functional and wellappointed breakfast was decent although the range was limited   the main issue was checkin there was no desk instead some guy wandered over after a few minutes holding a tablet which he then tried to check us in on it took forever with no real understanding of why he consulted his phone he spoke to someone else he faffed around as if he had all the damn time in the world a sack that guy and hire someone who has people skills b just build a damn desk and install a real computer ffsits a new hotel sidewalk is still being worked on average room size for a big city  modern  small but working desk and chair  open armoire functions well and i prefer it to a dresser tv  back lit headboard and two side lights  bathroom has a single vanity shower and toilet  needs a safety bar in the shower  be careful the shower floor can get slippery  no individual toiletries  fast wifi no drops  great soundproofing  not much noise can be heard from a very busy street out front  breakfast is free  a bit limited in variety  juice coffee machines cereal yogurt some fruit croissant  sort of a small eating area so it gets crowded  staff was friendly and helpful  spoke fluent english housekeeping was good check in is at two small desks  when youthe bed food and the staff was all great  it was 30 minutes from the city with the metro and 15 hours from the airport whit the train and metro  the breakfast was good for everyone something else  the day you go home you can leave your stuff at the hotel and pick it up later tot freethe strike is killing business this hotel is too far to walk a taxi ride from eiffel tower costs 40 a taxi to the only working metro is 15 we liked the room small but nice but there are no microwave or refrigerator as advertised once the strike ends paris will return to normal and transport will become much cheaperthe location is very good near to stations malls shops and restaurants the room is very good the stuff are so friendly and helpful any time they smile all the time specially receptionist no 6 she is very nice really it was a good accommodation and hospitality from all stuffpros  brandnew hotel with large modern rooms and stylish common areas  friendly and helpful staff  very affordable if booked early  free breakfast  just 4 minutes away from metro line 7  cons  located in a desolate neighborhood that is still under construction and utterly devoid of charm  no cafes restaurants or shops in the immediate vicinity  requires at least 30minute metro ride into center of paris hotel is located on the fringes of the city  if youre looking to immerse yourself in the charm of parisian life this is not the place to be however if modern and very comfortable accommodations at a great price is your priority and you dont mind being further away from the heart of paris you will enjoy this modern hotel that is part of a reliable and1 when we entered the hotel we were not greeted in a friendly manner we were told to show our id given our room cards and thats it no friendly welcome 2 the room is very basic not much storage room for clothes could not even watch tv due to every channel being in french and no way of translating it to english 3 we asked one of the girls at reception for help with ordering food she tried to help us and got very frustrated and began to have a bad attitude towards us and we felt very uncomfortable 4 on the hotel page it states that there are staff who speak english french spanish and arabic no english speaking staff 1 or 2 staff members spoke slight english making it very hard to communicate people will be coming to stay here from all over the world you cannot have astaff were super friendly and available you would really feel welcome by the team the room design was really pleasant spacious functional and comfortable i would definitely recommend this hotel and i will come back for sureit is my sixth visit to paris and this hotel exceeded my expectations it is close to everywhere very clean and the employees are very professional and friendly they can always help the breakfast was also very good,the hotel staff is very friendly and the hotel is super clean and great decoration in the breakfast area. breakfast is ok except the option to boil your own eggs in a small dedicated kettle. the staff was exemplary both at the reception. location  far from center looks dangerous but metro station is in 2 min walknice hotel as expected  good location near subway the room is a bite tiny and not loudness.
La Chambre du Marais,lovely boutique hotel great location easy walking to everything or short walk to several metro lines  staff were wonderful and accommodating  rooms  clean perhaps not overly

boutique property impeccably put together maintained and staffed wonderful breakfast service and fabulous beds the only quibble is that the rooms are a little small not much room to place your luggage a great value inparis in a fun neighborhoodrented 3 rooms for 3 days and was very happy about this hotel lovely neighborhood and 7 min work to the marais shopping area really great staff that always are extremely helpful i will definitely stay at la chambre du marais againwe thoroughly enjoyed our stay the room though small was very comfortable the beds were great it was quiet and very clean the hotel staff was very attentive helpful and polite i would highly recommend this hotel in the maraisi am wary to deliver such an outstanding review as we want to keep this hotel all to ourselves but we do want to give the entire hotel and staff our sincerest gratitude for helping make our stay with you extra special we have stayed at other small luxury hotels in paris and other countries around the world and this far exceeded our expectations we can not say enough good things about our stay at your beautiful and welcoming hotel in the middle of one of our favorite neighborhoods in all of paris your staff could not have been any more attentive and there was not a single thing we needed during out entire four day stay we are definitely looking forward to our next stay with you very soonexcellent hotel friendly staff great breakfast close to shopping and metro  if you want to stay in a real parisian neighbourhood try le marais you hear mostly french  staff at hotel very helpful and accommodatinga great cozy hotel in a great quiet location 15min walk to the notre dam cathedral excellent breakfast and service service was great as well a few restaurants right downstairs dont have to go farif you like contemporary boutique hotels this is the place for you we loved our stay there   located in the northwest corner of the marais near the place de la republique it was a section we had never explored before the immediate streets are quiet include welldesigned residential apartment buildings exclusive shops and bistros open for lingering even the graffiti was interesting  our room felt private was spacious elegant and comfortable the website coyly suggests the romantic possibilities of the rooms and we could see their point its the kind of space you could see yourself staying in without bothering to leave until checkout a small but modern elevator takes you to your floor but the stairs are easy the design of the reception and lounge area is a biti cannot recommend this little hotel enough choose this beautifully decorated boutique hotel if cleanliness efficient storage space in your room and a concierge staff that will do everything possible to make your trip great are your top priorities i will always make la chambre due marais my top choice when visiting paris all other guests were also gracious kind and respectful as well everything is curated to perfection and the experience shows itsmall hotel nearly lobbyless but clean comfortable and very friendly  we had an unfortunate broken foot occurrence and faby took care of us like we were relatives  excellent breakfast and service too  would definitely stay again provided faby and the crew remainsso happy with our too short stay at la chambre  faby the manager was onsite daily and so so friendly  the room was very european in size but beautiful and spectacularly clean im not sure ive ever seen a more pristine hotel room  the bathroom was very roomy and absolutely beautiful  this being our first visit to paris we were told by friends to stay in the marais neighborhood and we are very glad we did  we fell in love with paris immediately and are constantly looking opportunities to return  faby and la chambre du marais are fantasticsmall and friendly helpful and efficient i would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family traveling to paris i was here for a birthday celebration with my sister and we were able to easily access everything needed at the hotel and int he neighborhood it was quiet and lively a special experienceas other reviews state the rooms are tiny which is not a big deal if you are expecting it it is  especially nice that they have underbed chambers for luggage to make a little more space in the room the air conditioning turns off in the rooms during the day which made them extremely uncomfortable even though it wasnt especially hot outside   the day staff was very helpful with luggage we pulled up around the corner because rue de archives is pretty narrow and we had a lot to unpack i was so thankful for the help carrying everything in and up to the room we also had the day staff book us a car to the airport which worked very well especially considering there was a marathon on the day of our departure so im not sure we would have found a cab any other way   the locationi lived in paris many moons ago and many of my friends live in the neighborhood but i wanted to treat myself and this place was a truly a treat great location and beautiful spot especially for a couplebooked alexander suite 5 th floor  for a girls trip  pretty view from my room  so many restaurants within 5 minute walk  comfy bed  large bathroom with deep bathtub and large shower  closet space but no dresser  staff were super accommodating and sweet  breakfast is yummy and theyll bring to your room if needed  leah is a doll   shops  museums  tourist interest places are walking  10 to 45 minutes or take metro   eiffel tower was pleasant hour walk past lots of crepe  coffee places and we walked past notre dame  enjoyed walking we found some cool shops restaurants down the many  little streets  only 19 rooms in this adorable well decorated hotel so excellent service is part of the package   side note on paris 92021 we had to show my cdc vac card most of thegood location and friendly staff at this small hotel   we did have an annoying sound from running water all the night and maybe it came from a broken toilet  informed about this when checking out but did not feel it was taken at noticestaying here now and we love this hotel  a warm welcome cappuccino and homemade biscuits upon arrival  room is spacious extremely comfortable and with views of the hotels terrific neighborhood sounds of kids laughing in play

breakfast selection was great and the food tasted very fresh every morning the hotel staff were incredibly friendly and spoke great english they always made the extra effort to help us with any inquiries we had we would definitely stay at this hotel again  its great for the pricethe check in was a chaleenge as the guy at the reception kept on talking to me in french though it was obvious that i did not understand what i did not undestand him no tea or cofee making facility and no parking and the taxi had to double park to drop us blocking trafic rooms are tiny and value for money was very badthis small hotel located near the pernety metro station in montparnasse was ideal for our fiveday stay  rooms were smallof coursebut the bed was very comfortable and everything worked the staff speak english and were always helpful breakfast is available in the hotel but we brought our baked goods in from the patisserie next door  the streets nearby have numerous small restaurants bakeries bars and fruit and vegetable shops and seemed very safe for an evening strollnice room for 3 people at the top floor good for travelling and short stay we stayed only from evening to the morning it was comfortable there was some little details that could be improved in the equipment but it didnt bother us to mention everyday cleaning tea and coffee supply nice location close to the center and on the subway easy to reach bakery at the corner vegetable and fruit shop across the street and supermarket very close as well we enjoyed our 4 day staywe stayed 5 nights  room very small

bakery at the corner vegetable and fruit shop across the street and supermarket very close as well we enjoyed our 4 day staywe booked a superior room in this hotel for only one night as we went to paris for a concert  the room was very spacious as well as the bathroom which is not always the case we also had a very big bed probably a queen size also the room was quite clean last but not least the room was very quiet which is usually pretty hard to get in paris  the staff was very friendly  basically this is a nice hotel but maybe refresh can be donestayed here for a getaway week with my boyfriend we stayed here for 4 nights and yes the rooms are a little on the small side but for the two of us it was perfect it was always clean and tidy  our beds were made for us coming back as we spent all day out exploring paris lovely little bakery just on the corner too very friendly staff as well and had a lift which was great will definitely be back  also loved that it was in the back streets of paris  a great way to get the full culture just get off at pernety metro station and youre just 76 steps away yes i counted  fabulous hotel at a great pricewhat a great find its literally across the road from pertenety station so great links to the metro lines the pastry shop next door is truly amazing and the grocery shop opposite is great too   sorry i digress back to the hotel the staff were helpful and patient they knew english and even were paying to reach us a little bit of french too the room itself had the basics  strong wifi double bed which was very comfortable and the amenities were there too the room temp was ok too but we also had access to an ac unit so we knew we could always use that   the room size itself wasnt large but as a base to drop off your bags and sleep it met our requirements would recommend this hotel for anybody who wants to travel into paris on the cheapso this hotel was mediocre and then i broke my ankle coming down their tiny handicap ramp which is about 1 foot wide while leaving the hotel let me explain that this ramp had a free edge and no rail anyone and i am in good shape can easily lose their footing on this ramp and fall off i was coming down with my suitcase to check out when this happened the girl at the front desk came to see if i was ok but did not bother to write a report of any kind i couldnt go to the hospital in france because my flight was leaving in two hours and our taxi was outside i had no choice but to fly back to miami with a broken ankle needless to say this has been painfulstressful and very inconvienent the hotel didnt even bother to reply to my two emails when we checked in our bedsthe check in was a chaleenge as the guy at the reception kept on talking to me in french though it was obvious that i did not understand what i did not undestand him no tea or cofee making facility and no parking and the taxi had to double park to drop us blocking trafic rooms are tiny and value for money was very badi stayed for 7 days on the fifth day i went out for breakfast and when i returned 150 pounds and 100 dollars had disappeared from my bag the money was in a bag under clothes and inside a drawer when i got back to the hotel the bag was over the clothes and the money was gone  i spoke to the receptionist who was very rude to me he called the girl who had cleaned our room to ask her about the money i do not know if it was her or if it was someone else after all the key to the room is at the reception desk and anyone could have got it and got in there after that the only response i received from the receptionist was i do not like this and no one else said anything   to make matters worse on the last day i was at the front desk when a young man came in and attackedwe had a one night stay in this delightful hotel it was too short a visit and we must go back it could not have been more convenient less than 1 minute walk to the nearest metro station pernety the hotel is on the corner of a quiet street but set in a bustling location packed with parisian charm bars and brasseries with oudoor seating fresh produce market stalls cafes and restaurants  the staff of the hotel were friendly and welcoming the room we had was comfortable and clean with a large and very comfortable bed we really appreciated the tea and coffee making facilties on arrival we had a wonderful nights sleep as there was no late night street noise the view from our room was of the street below and we were able do our people watching from there the rooms on thewe stayed for one night in a triple room coming from montparnasse station the walk to hotel was not easy with luggage otherwise the location is great just few meters away from a metro station which takes you directly right in the middle of the tourist area the room was quite big but it the cleaning was not the best we found some hairs in the bath tube which is always a bad sign the carpet was dirty as well the air conditioning didnt work properly neither the extractor fan in the bathroom we could clearly hear voices from adjacent rooms until late in the night breakfast was poor and basic served in a cramped room if one maybe needs just some water instead of juice or coffee he wont find it  people at reception desk were helpful they helped with ordering inwe had a lovely 3 night stay here the staff were friendly and helped us with everything we needed the patisserie next door is amazing for breakfast she does like you to have a try at speaking french to her though shes quite grumpy when people just talk to her in english so no matter how bad your french make sure you have a go yes the rooms are small  its paris the bathroom had a full size bath with a shower over which had plenty of hot water and decent pressure  the bed was comfortable and the air conditioning worked fine  no its not a deluxe penthouse with views over the eiffel tower but the price reflects that it is a 3 star hotel and provided us with everything we needed for a really nice few days away oh and the metro is only a few steps from the hotel sohad a super nice stay at the 55 montparnasse we booked the top floor terrace room i think they had the only one and it was great it was a huge room especially since we were changing hotels from an ibis hotel the room had two twin beds we put them together awesome ac needed for august kettle safe living area and two views one window overlooking the cute pedestrian street below and the terrace overlooking the rooftops of paris the bathroom was big with a tub and nice amenities even had a towel warmer if in case you need to do hand laundry and needed it to dry overnight the best thing about the room was the terrace it had a little table and chairs and my wife and i spent alot of time out there there is a monoprix about 7 minute walk away but a closer franprix avery rude front desk  not helpful at all  they seem to be pleased to annoy tourists dirty rooms  very old fashioned bathroom  the pictures on their site is not at all what you get  pretty nice small lobby but rooms have not been renovated   dirty carpets dirty windows moreover vey noisy with no ac do not go therewe were a family of 3 adults visiting paris for 3 days in june 2018  we were very happy with our room as it was small 1 queen  1 rollaway bed but clean and comfortable  the aircon worked well which was a bonus and the room was quiet during our stay  the location is the best part of staying at this hotel  it is literally steps away from the pernety metro station and has many cafes fruit shops restaurants and supermarkets as well as a selfservice coin laundry down the road  you really do feel immersed in the parisian culture here as its out of the touristy part of town  it takes about 15mins by train to the centre of paris but navigating the metro is all part of the paris experience  we loved it  i would be happy to stay at this hotel again and would recommend itwe confirmed a reservation for this hotel on august 21st for vacation to celebrate a family event during the week of oct 22oct 28 six nights booked directly with hotel and received our confirmation direct thru email having traveled in this area of paris on many occasions we liked the location of the hotel having been in montparnasse as recent as july 2018 much to our surprise and dismay we received an email from le 55 montparnasse hotel on october 15  exactly one week from our stay that read your booking has been cancelled  with no explanation other than we look forward to your next stay with us  really imagine receiving that email one week from when your flight arrives in over 40 years of traveling i have never experienced this type of behavior and action from anyour room was compact but comfortable  the metro station was 200maway and there was lots of food options close  do not believe google maps if you are looking for supermarkets in the area  we found it sent us on a lot of circular wild goose chases for some reasonthe hotel is located in a very nice area just 3 minutes from the metro station pernety the street is lovely raymond losserand with many little shops caffees and small restaurants in general the hotel space is small starting with the lobby the elevator and going to the rooms the room i was given was really really small but for a place to sleep for 1 one person was enough not appropriate for more than one person as you can observe in the pictures everything was very clean the bathroom was small again sorry for repeating myself but comfortable and clean the noise can be a problem if you are a light sleeper and better to stay in the rooms facing the lateral alley for me it was not a problem as i had to wake up very early anyway the staff is very kind andthe staff were very welcoming and the hotel was quaint and in a nice neighbourhood however i couldnt sleep in the mornings because the walls were thin  i heard people in the rooms next door doors closing people talking in the hallway and people cleaning the rooms next doors which made it impossible to sleep until things quieted down around 11am  i also put the do not disturb sign outside the door and the cleaners still knocked on the door very loudly while i was trying to sleep midmorning  i also found blood stains on my duvet  it seemed clean and washed but the cleaners should check for stains before they make the bedsthis is not a 3 star hotel  only 3 rooms have been renovated so far  pictures do not correspond to what you get  beware of the cleaning ladies dirty floor dirty bathroom very noisy you hear the cars when the windows are closed vibrating floor when the tram runs   very rude  day time manager by name of deira when we asked for a the reason why they had such a rating  air conditionning was not working was too hot had to open the window overnight awful do not go there  there are plenty of other hotels around which offer a much better servicewe stayed for 3 nights during the uk bank holiday weekend and had no trouble finding the hotel via google maps near the metro station there are dozens of cafes bistros creperies brasseries and bars in the montparnasse area so you have easy walking access to them and of course are very close to central paris by metro the rooms are clean and surprisingly big compared to what we expected for paris there is a lovely boulangerie right downstairs with amazing fresh pastries and baguettes that we visited every morning and did our best with minimal french to order from the kind and patient staff very satisfied with out stay they cleaned the room each day and changed towels so thats just what we needed a convenience and comfortable base of operations for sightseeingmy family and i loved our stay here  wed come back in an instant perfect location  a dozen steps from the metro and from a street full of cafes and restaurants  but quiet enough for even very light sleepers the rooms are clean and modern and the staff are unfailingly friendly kind and helpful a real gem,good hotel for the price near the pernety metro station in few steps very quit neiberhood many place for fast food and reasturants also many grocerry stores the rooms in hotel are small but clean evry day cleaning breakfast is buffet tipical french stuff is very frendly higlly recommanded for  few day stay in paris.
Le Bristol Paris,soooo beautiful super clean quiet the restaurant in the garden soooo delicious i extremely recommended it only one thigh that you need to know its expensive maybe because we reserve it in the same day otherwise sooo nice experience visited in september 2020everything at le bristol is perfection from start to finish from the moment you set foot in the door you are treated like what i can only describe as royalty yet without pretention i have stayed at le bristol both as a paying guest and for a workpress trip and the 5star treatment has alwaysthe bristol hotel is the best hotel and a muststay for sophisticated travelers from the moment we walked in we were made very welcome this hotel offers incredible fivestar service the rooms are spacious clean and well equipped with beautiful marble bathrooms and an large shower about the room  the most striking details are the high quality smooth silk sheets which gave the perfect sleep after the after the long drive the bed was just heaven i travel a lot but ive never had such a confortable bed and such soft and fresh linen i chose this hotel for its superb location within easy walking distance of everything i wanted to see starting with the louvre and its beautiful square the avenue des champslyses and other attractions of the french capital i recommend iti have just completed a twoweek stay at le bristol following an unavoidable work commitment in paris the hotel is on top form and was a wonderful home away from lodon covid notwithstanding i was accommodated in an exceptional extremely large suite with a view of the eiffel tower which had been arranged prior to my arrival with a convenient desk and surrounding working area naturally adjustments have had to be made to make the hotel covid secure but these are pretty unobtrusive and convenient kits were provided with masks wipes and sanitiser the staff from the doormen through to the housekeeping and room service personnel were exceptionally friendly and efficient the facilities are superb epicure remains one of the outstanding restaurants in paris the bresse farmif you are looking for a central hotel with qualified and prepared staff with a nice garden to relax and with an exceptional bedding this is the place for you i had the pleasure of staying at this beautiful hotel a few months ago the suite i stayed in was absolutely gorgeous and i loved those first class amazing linens in fact i slept really well because i didnt hear any noise from the surrounding rooms and corridors and because the bed was large and comfortable with sumptuous and  clean  linens location was awesome and near to just about everything accessible on foot or short 5 minute cab to all major features of paris i would not hesitate for a single moment to recommend this fine hotel and i look forward to our next stay here  cant wait to go back thank you fori have been somewhat remiss in writing this review as my most recent stay at le bristol was in october 2019 but i have now written my review  i have been lucky enough to stay at le bristol a number of times for both business and pleasure and although i have not stayed in every single hotel in paris i can say with overwhelming certainty that you will be hard pressedunable to find another hotel in paris which can offer a comparable level of service attention to detail and facilities both related to accommodation and culinary that le bristol can in short if you want to impress your other half or even just to treat yourself whilst in paris a stay at le bristol should be considered mandatory  whilst in some establishments customer service can be treated as anif i find anything better ill let you know if you desire perfection in a hotel staff services and amenities this is it   in 1996 i asked a welltraveled older gentleman where to stay in ireland  he mentioned a hotel  i asked why he liked it and he said simply because it is the best hotel in the world  now clearly he had not been to every hotel in the world  my son and i stayed in this hotel when my son was  only 14 upon arriving having been welcomed by name the keys to the car taken our bags taken to the room shown to our rooms and asked if we were hungry and wanted some food which was shortly brought to our room we were looking out the window i explained to my son that the other hotel i considered was behind that tree in the field my son quicklyif youre looking for elegance warmth beauty and the feelings of true parisian luxury come stay at le bristol paris my boyfriend and i were lucky to stay here for my 30th birthday this march and from the moment you step foot in the lobby its like you are walking into a picture perfect snapshot setting the mood for what your whole stay will be like we were fortunate to have our room upgraded as a birthday surprise and when we were shown to our accommodations we were in awe of all the detail and care we saw every bouquet of flowers placed around the room sitting area bathroom were all real there was a plethora of treats to welcome and celebrate me for my birthday every window in our room opened up onto a balcony where we could stand and soak up the views ofthe location is very good because it is close to the champs elysees place de la concorde grand palais in short the hotel is a good starting point to visit paris also by public trasport the staff was friendly and kind the bedroom was confortable comfy bed great quality bedding clean and marvellous linens bedding and linens are both wonderfulbeen there for a weekend the hotel itself is perfect wheelchair accessibility is good the room was big enough with very comfortable shower and bath the entrance is flat there is special elevator for ground level worked wellwe returned to le bristol in mid november of 2019 a period in which the yellow vest protest movement was active and the cause of paralysis in paris the unfortunate and inescapable reality of european travel is that security issues have become important considerations    in this context we have never seen a hotel staff as informed and prepared as the le bristol is to deal with such issues  adroitly working to guide and protect its guests during turbulent times during our 2019 visit the management of le bristol had extraordinarily accurate and timely information as to the critical security and logistical consequences of the protests and resultant police activity throughout the city this high level of intelligence has obviously been honed during previous periods ofnot what i excpected not a typical unfriendly paris truly a friendly hotel it started from reception easy entry and helpful staff nice restaurant and the cozy bar definitely recommend this hotelthe hotel is located in the heart of the city within easy walking distance of anything you ever wanted to do or see in the city spacious rooms good food at the restaurant especially the breakfast the staff is helpful attentive and will do anything to make my stay special its recommended if youve got the moneyoverall a decent choice of hotel for paris service was truly great  the rooms start to feel a bit dated however and for the price charged and being one of the top hotels in paris i feel some form of upgrade is due we were also a bit disappointed with the room service for dinner  for these very high prices we dont not feel it was worth it or just had bad luck  so we switched to rather have food delivered to the hotel however room service for breakfast was excellent  a perfect french breakfastthis is the perfect hotel to enjoy a family trip in paris the entire team from concierge reception housekeeping dining were incredibly attentive and responsive they made us and our young kids feel welcome and cared forwe had lunch in le bristol and were extremely satisfied both with the food and the service the restaurant is beautiful with a sweet interior courtyard perfect staff from the ivy entrance to the waiters at the restaurant our meal was excellent as well as the wine coffee served with fantastic chocolates loved it nice place really a must visit place in france   environment was so awsome me and my family enjoyed a lot  our room for first night looked inside the building so we changed for the second night we ate at the hotel with our guests and both the food and service was great antoine served us perfectlytaking luxury to a new level le bristol paris surpasses the best of the best in every capacity but above all we received the warmest and most accommodating service from a staff that welcomed us from the moment we arrived we cannot recommend a better hotel to spend midnight  in paris we cant wait to come back we spent 8 nights at le bristol and can report that it has not lost a step coming  out of the pandemic  the physical plant is just as clean and beautiful as ever the staff as welcoming and warm as ever and the service throughout as prompt efficient and helpful as ever    we stayed in the lumiere suite and it is gigantic and yet very user friendly  all the usual amenities were included  bottle of champagne fresh fruit every day fresh flowers every other day twice daily maidturndown service  the formal dining room is not yet open yet so breakfast was in the lobby eating area but that will change in a few days  of course leah was everpresent shining her personality to all around her  if you are searching for a luxury hotel on the right bank le bristol is thewe decided to book our first international trip after a forced 18 months hiatus and we decided on paris as only an hour away on a flight this trip was planned mainly to celebrate my husbands birthday after much research we zeroed in on le bristol and we are really glad we did from prompt responses to my husbands queries by the concierge team before our travel to planning a  surprise birthday cake for my husband with cherry from room service the service was great even before we arrived  we were made to feel really welcome from the time we got off our taxi lillit at reception was a gracious hostess as we checked in the property itself is beautiful with a decadent old world charm tasteful decor and a sense of calm in sharp contrast to the chaos of parisian streetsnice property nice location excellent service all in all brilliant the only thing i can say that needs to be really sorted out was the concierge service any restaurant we asked them to book was not available according to them and they would recommend another restaurant but when we called directly we were able to get tables oh and yes very very pricey  buts its paris and the finest hotel there further the breakfast lounge while service was very friendly and prompt they normally got the order wrong toast would come ten minutes after

cared forwe decided to book our first international trip after a forced 18 months hiatus and we decided on paris as only an hour away on a flight this trip was planned mainly to celebrate my husbands birthday after much research we zeroed in on le bristol and we are really glad we did from prompt responses to my husbands queries by the concierge team before our travel to planning a  surprise birthday cake for my husband with cherry from room service the service was great even before we arrived  we were made to feel really welcome from the time we got off our taxi lillit at reception was a gracious hostess as we checked in the property itself is beautiful with a decadent old world charm tasteful decor and a sense of calm in sharp contrast to the chaos of parisian streetsnice property nice location excellent service all in all brilliant the only thing i can say that needs to be really sorted out was the concierge service any restaurant we asked them to book was not available according to them and they would recommend another restaurant but when we called directly we were able to get tables oh and yes very very pricey  buts its paris and the finest hotel there further the breakfast lounge while service was very friendly and prompt they normally got the order wrong toast would come ten minutes after the eggs or vice versa but always with a smile  sojust returned from

district straddling the 3rd and 4th arrondissements a savvy traveler friend directed us to the fivestar hotel le pavillon de la reine located on the place des vosges in the center of it all  this regal stone and brick structure beckoned visitors through a narrow passageway leading into a lovely courtyard with umbrellaed tables surrounded by greenery fronting the hotels main entrance given the season it was festively lit prompting many passersby to sate their instagram addictions the lobby and commonif you are looking for a refined elegant hotel near le marais this is it  the hotel decor is

friendly   my only criticism is that the support staff could be better trainedthis is our second stay at le pavillon  we have been visiting the marais for about 20 years and the location cant be beat

beautiful property in a wonderful part of paris the rooms are fine not that large but they are very well appointed the hallways are quite dark and dingy with low ceilings elevators are tiny and quite old as well i wanted to like the hotel but from the beginning when i entered the property i didnt feel well taken care of or as if the staff even wanted me there as a guest i didnt find the service for breakfast to be helpful or friendly either next time i come to paris i would probably choose another hotel or just stay in an air bnb as i usually do in pariswe were lucky enough to stay here just before lockdown began we had  a lovely room which was beautifully decorated we settled in immediately the hotel was also very accommodating over dietary issues which is always tricky in france we met many guest who where hotel regulars fashion week which is always a good signthe only negative was the shower no bath in the room but i hadnt checked before  i will definitely stay here againi stayed here for a relaxing weekend away with my mother in fall 2019 the hotel is absolutely gorgeous i particularly loved the breakfast they offered in the hotels cosy dining room the location on the place des vosges has great shopping and culture it is the perfect location to offer you a glimpse of true parisian life while also having lots to do the hotel is adjacent to the marais a wonderful district in paris it is also near many museums and just a short drive from other big paris sitespdlr is the perfect hotel for a quiet restful stay in paris  in the heart of the bustling marais service is great and while limited by covid guidelines for certain services overall the hotel was able to remain accommodating and hospitable for requests great concierge service that helped me repair my suitcase same day arrange for a rapid covid test to be conducted in the comfort of my room and of course  all general restaurant reservation and museum tickets etc ill be coming backthis is a hotel that gets every

Le Relais Montmartre,decent hotel good location but overpriced and bare bones amenities would stay again provided there is a price reduction and more bathroom toiletries included staff mostly friendly with exception of one young mangreat atmosphre professional kind understanding staff perfect location if you want to be in montmartre clean rooms nice staff dlicate great reception staff so service minded just  nicei cannot reccommend le relais highly enough if you would like to spend a magical time in montmarte this is the place to stay right in the heart of this magical area within walking

decor staff were were friendly and helpful our room was perfect  and very quiet as we overlooked the courtyard we would definitely come back and stay againwe stayed in this hotel during summer and we had a great experience first of all we booked a simple room and as we had a lot of luggage they offered to storage most of the luggage that we wouldnt use in their own compartment which has helped a lot as we booked a small room they dispose of a nice friendly front desk service that helped us a lot giving tips about restaurants and things to do  checkin is allowed even very late as we had a very late flight arrival and for me it was just great   i will definitely come back to this hotel next summer and hope theyll be open because theyve been closed for long time due to covid issuesbeautifully decorated and clean room the interiors have been put together to really cater to those american fantasies of what paris must be like  with striped wallpaper thick carpets and curtains and lowkey classically designed furniture it didnt really feel like a hotel more like your rich parisian aunts spare room  the rooms are not huge especially if there are two of you but that is typical for paris and certainly very good for the price its expensive here above and beyond value for money i would suggest in comparison to other parisian hotels   the staff were very friendly and kind and the hotel

room 2we liked the neighborhood 3we liked the hotel service 4 the impeccable cleanliness of the hotel 6the cordiality of the staff and provider to help us when we ask for information about paris and transportation 5we want to returna very cute hotel we were in the bottom room with windows that opened to the street it was a little loud first thing in the morning or when other guest were rowdy due to being located right next to the lobby but overall that was only the most minor of things we noticed the bathroom was fantastic heat towel rack quality products wonderful hot waterhigh pressure lots of closetstorage space seperate wc the room was larger than we expected as well front desk was so friendly greeted us each time we arrived and were able to provide us ice on request i tore my acl just before the trip so needed ice regularly after a day of touring i loved the writing desk in the morning sun although the view was of the sidewalk the transparent curtains we perfect for allowing inmy wife and i stayed here for four nights from 14th  17th  february it is about a 3  4 minute walk from metro station blanche blue line 2 so easy to get to from gare du nord station the hotel is very clean and our room 202 was very quiet breakfast is plentiful although we felt a little expensive  but we are in paris so it is to be expected staff very helpful and friendly and could not be faulted  the hotel is in a perfect position for the tourist the moulin rouge is adjacent to blanche station and next door to moulin rouge is a good irish bar check out the latin dance room at the back of the bar place du tertre is about a 1215 minute walk where you will find artists busy painting and drawing  basillica sacre coeur is next to the square blanche station willthis is such a lovely hotel and exceeded our expectations excellent value for money and the staff were very helpful relaxed atmosphere and quiet location near montmartre the classic room was small but comfortablewe stayed for 3 days last week and booked a larger room i thought it would have been bigger but it was very comfortable and the bed was wonderful with good quality linens  the room and bathroom were a bit old fashioned and dated but it was fine for a few days there wasnt much spare space for baggage so if there are 2 of you with 20kg bags you might  struggle  the location was spot on and was just off the rue de lepic and just down the hill from the montmartre area with loads of bars and good restaurants in close proximity the place du clichy was within easy walking distance as was the moulin rouge if you re into that sort of thing   i would go back here thanks to the very friendly staffi can not fault this hotel it is a three star hotel that achieves well above that as soon as we stepped into it we were welcomed incredibly warmly they were gracious enough to allow me to practice my french and immediately upgraded our room the room had everything we expected very clean excellent shower and v comfortable bed the location is wonderful you can walk and do the tourist bit at the sacre coeur  eat at a different restaurant for each meal and feel very welcomed into montmatre fabulous biscuit shops cheese delicatessens seafood shops  totally wonderful we will be backstaff extremely polite and most helpfulroom clean and comfortablelocation perfect for what we wanted to visit it would be helpful to have english speaking channels on the television  great coffee on tap free of charge on receptioncould use a handle on the wall of the bathroom to assist getting in and out the bath and or showera lovely hotel well recommended we came over for the rugby and was pleasantly surprised rooms were clean and on point the breakfast area was typical french parisian cellar and the food was of a quality you would expect from this hotel quite a gem im sure i will be backthis was a very nice place to stay room was big and comfortable i stayed right off the lobby so it was a bit noisy with the comings and goings great location close to subway and near bus lines and a short walk to nice streets with cafes and lots of shops also close to a really good bakery  staff was very helpful and friendly  definitely would stay here againwe enjoyed our stay at le relais montmartre it was our first time in paris and it was perfect for what we needed we wanted to be in the city but stay away from the noise and touristy part of paris there are endless cafes and attractions in the area that are walkable three major metro stops makes getting into the city proper very simple the hotel was very clean and the staff were friendly the area was very safe if i was traveling alone i would feel very comfortable staying here as a womanwe were very impressed with the size of the room very nicely decorated and very handy location  very close to moulin rouge the checkin and out was very easy and the normal checkout time was much later than most thank youa small hotel surrounded by many cafes and restaurants about 5 mins walking distance the main floor lobby is very clean there is an option of buffet breakfast although this wasnt included with my stay the room was kept very clean each day free nespresso coffee was provided in the reception as well as a free thea in the room staff was very friendly and courteous specially the young man always smiling you are required to pay a small city taxes fee per night we stayed in a superior room i would recommend this hotel for family and couplecomfortable clean hotel in a lively area with easy access to the metro  room was comfy and quiet  lots of bistros and grocery stores nearby  reception was nice and helpful  second stay here and would come againa lovely stay in a gorgeous hotel staff were lovely especially lyndsey on reception we will be back very soon a great location and so near to sacre coeur rooms were so clean and very tastefully styledstayed at le relais for 4 nights and i really enjoyed it hotel rooms and bathroom appear more spacious than usual in paris the room is clean and very comfortable and in the bathroom they provide you daily with nice utilities of rituals  breakfast is good 15day but only had it once still i think if you have a bit of time theres plenty of cafes and boulangeries nearby which offer a more authentic paris breakfast feeling as quite common in paris the breakfast room is on the lower level 1 in a kind of basement environment  also location is perfect just so close to rue abbesses with all its bars cafes and restaurants and close to many tourist spots sacre coeur moulin rouge metro blanche is just 5min walking distancethis provided an excellent base for our fourday stay in paris  we found the hotel wellplaced for exploring the city on foot the metro being on strike but particularly for visiting the area around the sacre coeur  an added bonus was listening to the impromptu jazz quartet that set up on the corner on sunday morning  the staff were always very friendly and the provision of a complimentary coffee when we came back to retrieve our bags after wed checked out was most welcomewe stayed in three different hotels in paris and this was by far our favorite  although the space was small the rooms were wellequipped and decorated with antiques and rustic beams on the ceiling  the beds were very comfortable and there was plenty of hot water in the shower  the staff was very helpful overall very charming and romantic and location in montmarte was great  we would definitely recommend staying herebeautifully decorated and clean room the interiors have been put together to really cater to those american fantasies of what paris must be like  with striped wallpaper thick carpets and curtains and lowkey classically designed furniture it didnt really

lady at the reception gave us a room with a bathtub so we could relax the room was kind of small but it was space well made use of its nearby to the eiffel tower and cute cafes with everything walking distance and a metro right across the street it made things easywe stayed one night during a recent trip to paris overall i was happy with the room it was well priced centrally located within a short stroll to the eiffel tower and we had a decent sized room compared to some tiny paris hotels i have stayed in previously the room and bathroom were spotlessly clean the bathroom in particular was very generously sized we had a good nights sleep and were not disturbed by any external noise at all  all staff that we interacted with were lovely and the included breakfast was very good and plentiful my one criticism is that the smell of cigarette smoke in the room was very very strong as soon as we opened the door it hit us we had to air the room out and spray perfume to try to mask the smell unfortunately smoking in paris is verymy stay was very good clean and comfortable rooms the receptionist dorine was very helpful and helped me out with recommendations and with my lugagge thanks a lot close to the eiffel tower 10min walk max and subway 8 takes you everywhere 20min to bastillewe arrived early after an overnight flight and encountered henry at the front desk who affably helped us with an early checkin he was consistently helpful and went out of his way to ensure we had what we needed throughout our stay the hotel is literally across the street from the dupleix metro station which we used nearly daily to get around the city the hotel is also tucked into an area with a number of interesting restaurants and cafes however what made our stay excellent was henry who really excelled at ensuring we had a pleasant experience and made it feel like a second home for the weekwe had a nice two days stay at this hotel which is very close to eiffel tower and local restaurants and pubs clean room and very good location average breakfast without scramble egg and sussage and bacon breakfast room at the basement and very small after a hectic second day trip we came to hotel with some take away meal and which needed reheat so went downstairs to the basement to buy some drinks and to see if anybody there so that we could use the microwave so didnt see anybody there so went upstairs to to ask if we could use the microwave and there you go the very very very very rude doraine who treated us like a criminal by going downstairs first without asking her she told us this not you house this the hotel and blah blah blah  bloody hell we paid 358 pound for thesmall but nice and clean hotel near the eiffel tower the metro station is nearby and everything is in the neighborhood specially a fantastic bakery for the breakfast in front of the hotel the rooms are small but clean and well equipped the best thing is the staffabsolutely wonderful hotel room with a view of the eiffel tower which shows the upper half of the tower as it rises above the next building pictures included customer service was impeccable upon arrival henry the front desk clerk was charming and kind making check in stress free especially after our taxi driver attempted to scam us on way from train station yikes he even went out of his way to help point out great local cuisine and places to visitavoid on our trip give him a raise cute room gorgeous and clean bathroom close to many of the sites we wanted to seethis hotel has the worst customer service  i was dealing with a women named magdalena  she does not reply to email and ignores all travel agent requests  i was supposed to be a client there on the 17th of july  20th of july 2020 and due to the global pandemic and current travel ban was unable to attend   all hotels in europe had no issue in offering a refund  but paris  magdalena ignores all emails which is rather frustrating when you are an international traveller   i have informed the hotel of the current accc policy but they refuse to give my money backstayed for two nights following reopening tempted by a reduced rate  location is great for getting around paris and rooms are spacious by paris standards  rooms and property seemed generally clean and safe with attention to heightened health standards  the welcome and reception staff could have been warmer not hostile but certainly not friendly  with current competition and affordable rates all over the city i would look elsewhereexcellent location right in the heart of things  room was very clean and well presented and staff were all very friendly and helpful  my only complaint was that i couldnt stay longer  perhaps another timegood place to stay at was surprised be the elevator its not like the most french buildings its normal i had a good room with the view to the eiffel tower and it made my trip unexpectedly beautiful and magical,we got to stay at le relais saint charles after our connection to mauritius got cancelled due to a cyclon on december 30th 2019. The hotel is super close to the eiffel tour and lots of good restaurants and coffee shops  the room was spacious and very clean the mattress was super comforable  even though we spent only one night at this hotel i would definitely go back there for a longer stay.
Le Relais des Halles,i stayed in room 107 top floor 6th december 2019 it was overall very good and even though it was classed as a single had enough room for actually 2 people bathroom was a good size and amenities were also goodand it was also very quiet the reception staff were all very good especially the guy working saturday afternoons and sunday mornings  the one minor gripe was the breakfast the selection of bread was ok but very hard baguettes and there could of been better choices in meatsexcellent little hotel very close to metro stop great area yes its a little noisy but its paris very impressed with decor shower toiletries were great very comfortable bed coffee facilities in room lindt chocolates in reception and able to get bottles of water foc all staff friendly and helpful we were able to drop of bags before check in would definitely recommendwhilst the le relais des halles is only rated 3 star we found our stay to be 5 star location is fabulous in the heart of paris   the rooms were spacious in terms of paris location cleanliness was exceptionalamenities first class  breakfast was delicious and fresh and the staff could not be more accommodating in particular   the front desk where we would like to thank mr romar who went above and beyond expectations in assisting us from sharing local knowledge organizing tickets and helping coordinate transport during the strike  i could not recommend highly enoughhad a night stop over in paris and ended up here by chance it was a really good place to stay and very friendly staff i would recommend this address if staying for a short time in paris very central and well decorated a great place to bewe stayed there for christmas week excellent little hotel the staff is very nice and helpful the rooms are not too large but comfortable and very clean excellent beds and bathrooms breakfast is also quite nice our room on the third floor was quiet  metro etienne marcel is less than 5 minutes away the georges pompidou center is 5 minutes away on foot the louvre is 12 minutes away  the dorsay museum is about 30 minutes away the hotel is located within the pedestrian zone with many interesting shops restaurants and bars the only sortcoming is also related to the location we had to go to a nearby busy corner to get a taxi or an uber  some drivers can figure out how to get to the hotel door some cannot figure it outwe stayed at le relais des halles for a full week so really got to know the hotel pretty well  the location is about as good as it gets its a 5 minute walk from all the metro and rer lines at chateletles halles which means you can take the rer b train from cdg take exit 3 out of the station and walk a few minutes to get to the hotel the neighborhood that the hotels in is lively and interesting and its just a short walk to some very nice shopping streets like rue montorgueil and rue rambuteau   the staff was very welcoming and knowledgeable i really appreciate that

gavei had an excellent stay at this hotel the room was lovely and well organized the bathroom was spacious and the shower was very good the beds were comfortable i was on the 5th floor and the elevator was convenient my only complaint is the noise if you sleep with the windows closed noise will not be a problem the windows are pretty soundproof  i prefer to sleep with the windows open so noise was a problem for me the area has lively bars and can be quite noisy  especially if there is a soccer match  well into the evening midnight on the whole i was very happy with this hotel and would certainly return it is a great value i arrived via rer b from cdg  the trip was fast and easyle relais des halles is a beautifully renovated gem in the heart of paris  we were there for 6 nights i kept thinking that this hotel must have done focus groups as they designed the space and services because they succeeded in delivering a great customer experience on every score  first of all its small and beautifully appointed  secondly it is located within walking distance of everything metro stops st eustache chatelet halles the louvre the pompideau rue monteguiel the opera etc  cant be beat  they also provide a very substantial and delicious made to order breakfast in their lower level cave  really cant be beat and as long as they are able to keep their quality and prices reasonable

get to the hotel the neighborhood that the hotels in is lively and interesting and its just a short walk to some very nice shopping streets like rue montorgueil and rue rambuteau   the staff was very welcoming and knowledgeable i really appreciate that they were able to check us in and get us into our room even though we arrived very early that was a nice start to our stay i thoroughly enjoyed the history lesson one of the men on the front desk gavevery nice staff clean and comfortable room ive choose a deluxe with coffee and tea facilities wonderful shower and hairdryer very good breakfast in a small but nice room and again nice staff best location you can walk everywherei stayed here with my partner for 2 nights we arrived slightly early for check in and asked if they would hold our bags luckily our room was ready so they checked us in early which was fab when we got to our room we were not disappointed the room was light and had lots of space for the two of us the bathroom was spotless im very picky with bathrooms and i could not find one fault you are even provided with a pot full of ear plugs cotton buds and any little extra you may have forgotten to bring there is even a shower puff provided its the small touches that make a hotel feel welcoming there was a bluetooth speaker an ipad kettle and a mini fridge with a mini bar available the staff were friendly and always offered us bottles of water for our days out our room wasoverall we really enjoyed staying at le relais des halles for the week that we were in paris i really loved the size of the rooms and the free pocket wifi that the hotel provided as well as the price point and location of the hotel the drawbacks were that the room faintly smelled like cigarettes it was a nonsmoking room but i think that the walls were thin next to the building beside the hotel or smoking from the street below wafted up it was enough to make me feel sick a few times also the hotel room was stifling hot at night and we had to sleep with the windows open which led to noise at all times of the night in our room the hotel is located on a very busy street which is great but it is noisy until about 2 or 3 am most nights one morning i woke up at about 6had a night stop over in paris and ended up here by chance it was a really good place to stay and very friendly staff i would recommend this address if staying for a short time in paris very central and well decorated a great place to begood hotel good location close to marais and lots of different subway lines lots of shops and restaurants close by comfortable room but quite noisy at night as the streets around it have a few bars and restaurants and the windows are not soundproof great breakfasti brought my wife to paris for her 40th birthday and we stayed in the relais des halles the location of this hotel is possibly the best you could wish for in paris with les halles and tienne marcel metro stations within 35 minutes walk and the rer from cdg airport stopping in les halles the room is very well appointed with tea  coffee making facilities a fully stocked mini bar safe and wardrobe well sized ensuite and television the hotel has a lift and restaurant although we did not use the restaurant ourselves the room and hotel in general is very clean and well presented and the staff are friendly and very helpful i would highly recommend the relais des halles and will definitely stay there again ifwhen we return to the wonderful cityi have been to paris several times and try to stay in a different area every time so this trip i chose to stay in the first arrondissement the location is a block from the form les halles and about 2 blocks from the pompedieu center this made it super easy to get anywhere from the massive chatelet les halles metro station you also can easily walk to notre dame the louvre and other sites the room i stayed in a double room was very spacious be european and everything was updated and very nice the staff in particular farid were very helpful the breakfast was good and they will make you an omelet really no negatives although took them a while to get the rooms cleaned but minor in the big picture i would definitely stay here againwe had the best stay at this hotel  cannot fault it  everything was perfect even when paris went into lockdown due to covid19 they were helpful  its the best location possible with easy access to the metro and plenty of places to walk to  we will definiately stay here again should we visit paris againthis hotel is so exquisite along the management and all member of the staff  it feels like a boutique hotel the attention to details are impeccable along the cleanness and the interior   all team ensure you are welcome and they do whatever it takes to make your stay

truly exceptional with easy access to the sights on foot or via subway and to the airport via rer train neighborhood is very lively and i felt very safe walking alone at night my room was tiny but very well appointed and charming the bathroom was large and well equipped with great water pressure closet capacity was very good what really caught my attention were the inroom amenities a powerful

pricyhotel is very close to many of restaurants shops metro stations and a westfield shopping mall we walked to notre dame louvre and champes elysees rooms were on the small side with a closet a desk and of couple chairs we had a corner room and on the weekends you could hear noise from nearby restaurants till late we got used to it after the 1st night nice size bathroom breakfast was excellent eggs cooked to order just askbathroom cleanliness a 9,We stayed at le relais des halles for a full week so really got to know the hotel pretty well. The location is about as good as it gets its a 5 minute walk from all the metro and rer lines. Breakfast was delicious and fresh and the staff could not be more accommodating. i thoroughly enjoyed the history lesson one of the men on the front desk gave.
Le Relais du Louvre,location is superb next to louvre everything is at it should bespotless superior beddings and i like the fact that breakfasts are served in the room  if theres anything to add maybe lighting in the corridor next to elevatorwonderful location about a 30 second walk to the louvre the subway and great restaurants and bakeries  they also have a friendly and accommodating staff  the showers are a little smaller than what you would find in america but the old world charm makes up for it  i would definitely stay at this hotel againgood location clean  and small rooms good breakfast noise  there is a construction site nearby so please choose a room on the backyard  and the maids are friendly the front desk could provide more information this was a great hotel in a great location just a short walk to the louvre and a few metro stations the hotel was welcoming and clean the staff were very friendly and helpful the room was larger than expectedmy husband and i recently stayed at this hotel for a wedding anniversary trip  we wanted something close to everything but also quiet and quant  we found it  relais du louvre is literally across from the louvre museum and is a short walk to the festive left bank area  the staff as wonderful and accommodating and our jr suite was very comfortable  there are several metro stations nearby and the evenings were wonderfully quietthe hotel was built in the 1700s it is well kept and charming the service is pleasant and professional they serve breakfast in your room which is a nice touch easy walking distance to the louvre and several other points of interestle relais du louvre is in a convenient central location next to the louvre and easy walking distance from ile de la cit and many other sights as well as a tourism bureau and several metro stops  hotel staff members are very accommodating and knowledgeable  they gave us great recommendations and provided a car service with excellent drivers who knew how to avoid traffic snarls to and from the airport  as the hotel has had problems with its elevator it may not be a good choice for guests who are mobility impairedthe hotel has a perfect location for sightseeing several museums and historical attractions are within a 20 min walk but the hotel is also within walking distance to several metro lines and taxi stands the breakfast is amazing and the staff is friendly and helpful we will 100 stay here again if we find ourselves in pariswe stayed here the weekend before christmas  the transport strikes made moving around paris quite challenging but the staff were able to make suggestions and arrangements for us which ensured that our plans werent affected  we stayed in connecting rooms which worked really well for us  the hotel is clean comfortable and stylish  yes the rooms are small but worth it for the convenience of the location  the breakfasts are generous  highly recommendedgreat small boutique hotel  if you like carpet in the room and want to have breakfast in the room you cant have breakfast outside the room thats a big minus for me but everything else was nicei was delighted with this hotel the location was a few minutes walk to the louvre the metro and many restaurants the staff were so helpful from the time we checked in to our request for a taxi at 3 am to get to the airport going home we actually stayed in two separate rooms because our original booking through my company website was for a single although the hotel was fully booked the lovely woman working the desk put us in a room beside the church beautiful view the first night and then moved all our luggage including our champagne in the refrigerator to a larger room next door for the second night the rooms were beautifully furnished roomy enough the beds soft and comfortable and the tvs nice and large i would stay here again and would highly recommend thisthe hotel is perfectly located central to everything  my stay coincided with the largest transportation strike since the 1990s but that barely affected me since everything i wanted to do was easily accessible by foot giving me ample opportunity to explore the city  the hotel is clean and comfortable and the staff are very courteous and helpful  i was traveling alone but felt very safe in the hotel the neighborhood and throughout paris  i highly recommend itwhat a lovely cosy friendly boutique hotel our room had everything we needed and the bed was very comfortable rm 62 the breakfast is lovely huge and its a great touch to have it brought into the room every day so you can enjoy it in bed everywhere is spotlessly clean and the staff so very accommodating the local is perfect close to everything shops bars and restaurants we had a wonderful time and would definitely stay here again thank youexcellent stay and location will visit again in the near future staff and reception was excellent and very friendly best location for us in paris good connection to the metro and st germain and the louvreright across the road from the louvre and the seine river is practically on your door step the protesters stopped us from going to the louvre as they had barricaded the doors  but we walked to the eiffel tower instead  very clean staff are amazing and all in all it was a lovely staythis boutique hotel was so quaint it made you feel at home its located so close to the louvre notre dame the seine and walking distance to so much like restaurants and street side shops   there was some construction going on so the staff moved us to a different room i would definitely stay here again ifwhen i visit againthe location was wonderful it was opposite the louvre and central to the rest of the sights in paris there were a lot of lovely cafes and restaurants close by all within walking distance we had a cute little view of a church and the louvre from our window the staff 2 lovely women were very knowledgeable about the area and could recommend everything from restaurants hairdressers and pharmacy if they didnt know the answer they would call around and ask for you the hotel itself was clean tidy well appointed and had that definite french charm we would love to stay

recommendedamazing staff and very comfortable hotel  the service was ideal especially during a difficult period such as the quarantine in paris after spending 3 months i recommend this hotel with no hesitationim sorry it has taken me over 17 months to write this reviewi apologize our stay at le tsuba hotel was fantastic from the moment we arrived and were greeted by manuel the concierge i knew we made the right choice   manuel personally greeted us and escorted us to our room once in our beautiful room he began to give us a plan for our quick visit to paris pointing out restaurants nearby giving us suggestions for our louvre adventure and showing us the closest metro station he cam with brochures and maps and had a plan for usunsolicited  we had been traveling all day from amsterdam and were in the mood for wine and a baguette so down stairs i went found manuel and he escorted by two doors down to the wine shop i dont know french so he took control with themy husband and i stayed at hotel tsuba for 7 nights we were always greeted with a smile the staff went above and beyond to fulfill our needs one gentleman in particular was such a helpful person he worked during the night shift unfortunately cant recall his name the breakfast buffet was amazing we had it brought up to the room one time cappuccinos and barfood staff were great our room was clean nice and spacious compared to other hotels we saw online in paris we utilized the sauna and the little gym area often it was perfect and again so clean we would definitely come back and stay totally recommend iti have been to paris many times but decided to stay in the 17th for the first time and i am so glad i did this hotel is nestled on a small side street filled with shops cafes and is a few short minutes from the arc de triomphe great neighborhood with a butsling atmosphere yet once i walked through the doors of le tsuba i was transmitted to a place of beauty and tranquility front desk staff is outstanding they cannot do enough for you from directions to providing a quality umbrella during the rain pleasant professional and always smiling the rooms are extremely clean with quality bedding complimentary toiletries a nice flat screen tv and a great roomy showerthere is also a great spa and sauna that you can reserve with the front desk and beautiful robes andtruly have nothing but praise for this boutique hotel we had such a truly fantastic holiday here for a very short three nights could have easily stayed the entire week wish we had the hotel is quite stylish yet classy the absolute best part was the locationzone we walked everywhere every single day and found it very safe and convenient dont let me forget the breakfast with all the fresh cheeses i adored every minute herethis was one of the loveliest places i have stayed in paris  the location is fantastic the rooms are large and well appointed and the staff is very friendly and accommodating  this is my fourth trip to paris for work and even with all of the citys amazing attractions i looked forward to being in my room or winding down with a cocktail at the end of the day  it was a quiet little oasis with a very comfortable bed  a great place to recharge before going back to work and exploring each daya great stay at le tsuba as always i have been staying here for the past few years i spent this past week at the hotel for work rooms are very comfortable and extremely clean nice size bathroom with  a great shower and towels the front desk staff is professional attentive and friendly  always a pleasure to return thank youwe were spending nearly 2 weeks at the hotel the hotel location are very good  you have metro near by  supermarket pharmacy bank and lot of thing to do around the area   the breakfast buffet was nice the staff many of them are very nice and helpful   as a long stay guest  the room cleaning is a bit complicated they didnt refill the soap  tea or cup after 1 week i ask them to change my bedsheet and its took 2 days for them to finally do it   if you looking for hotel with good location this one is good choice for youhalfway thorough my second weeklong stay at le tsuba my niece and i brought pastries down to the lobby to eat them with coffee we intended to buy there  the host came right up to us to let us know that we could only eat food purchased in the lobby bar or restaurant in the lobby  i was disappointed since 1 they dont sell pastries and 2 we had no other civilized place to eat them and 3 ive spent 4000 euros at this hotel in the past three months  its a nice place but they really shouldnt nickel and dime us   bottom line  great location very good rooms and breakfast buffet belowaverage exercise room friendly staff unaccommodating policescute hotel in a central part of paris it was easy to get to and from the metro when it was available and get around the city we didnt find a ton of cafes we liked within walking distance but there are so many option in paris so we werent at a loss the room was comfortable and had everything we needed it was on the smaller side but that was expected the gym area was great and the amenities were excellenthotel with a slight asian touch very nice employees great rooms good breakfast from my perspective not always easy in france and great location arc de triomphe is just two blocks from the hotelwe stayed here for 3 nights and absolutely loved it the staff were great so helpful and attentive breakfast was lovely the location was great our room was spotlessly clean i would highly recommend iteach time i go to paris

Les Jardins de Mademoiselle,this hotel is conveniently located in a nice neighborhood with many cafs restaurants and shops nearby incl an organic carrefour and an excellent vegetarian restaurant the staff is exceptional both during and prior to our visit they were so helpful getting us tickets finding us restaurants etc and we were even able to get into our rooms before check in the spa is great after a long day in paris just relaxing in the pool and steam bath comfortable beds and pillows lovely bathroom we requested a quiet room and got one facing the garden we didnt use the restaurant but found a bag of fresh madeleines and a recyclable bottle of water to welcome us all in all the hotel added to the great experience we had in paris6 hours into our stay here at les jardines de mademoiselle and already in love with the location the hotel and the staff analle was providing wonderful helpful information even prior to our arrival and it really started our trip out on the right foot the rooms are very pretty clean and have all of the amenities that we need including delicious macaroons d the location is walking distance to fantastic bars and restaurants and we can wait to keep exploring the city as our trip continuesa new building in a particularly appealing part of paris close to the metropolitain lots of very good restaurants close by rue du commerce with plenty of shops is just around the corner no parking at the hotel and no 5 minute parking in front either and we noted that cars parked in the street on a monday were all papered with e35 parking tickets there is a parking building about 7 minutes walk away  prepay for parking through parclick or similar and get a lower rate than advised to me by the hotel you also get unlimited entries and exits for the duration of your booking staff were all excellent spoke english fluently and couldnt have been more helpful housekeeping is of a very high standard  there is a swimming pool and a hammam at the first level souterrain whichwe stayed here for 3 nights in october 2019 the location of the hotel is excellent close to the commerce metro station within 3045 minutes walk of main paris attractions and a great selection of bars and restaurants close by the spa gym and pool facilities are great would definitely recommend this hotelstayed here for my birthday and the hotel was very modern and nice superior room was a bit too small though was about 6 to get to the eiffel tower by uber which was ok the rooftop area was nice the pool and steam room was great we asked for late check out unaware there was a massive cost due to miscommunication between my bf and the receptionist then we were charged 60 at check out ive stayed in other places and they never charged us the receptionist wasnt very nice about it bit unfortunate but apart from that really enjoyed my stay hereits not 1010 perfect as a hotel but theres a lot to like about les jardins de mademoiselle the rooms are very nice the bed comfy the bathrooms wellappointed with a superb shower a tranquil roof garden full of fragrant rosemary bushes raspberry plants and olive trees friendly and obliging staff a brilliant location  bang in the centre of town but tucked away down a quiet avenue   the only blip for us was that we had to call reception to turn on the airconditioning in our room as there was no controller in the room but well give them the benefit of the doubt as we were only there for one night and perhaps other rooms have controllers in themwe really liked this hotel  we stayed in the eiffel tower suite lovely pool great bed good shower and just a really nice relaxed feel  the restaurants and shops of the commerce district and its metro station are a short 5 minute walk away we walked to the eiffel tower from here   book it before everyone else finds ita nice contemporary hotel few blocks from the commerce metro station line 8 with very attentive front desk reliable service and a very modern clean interior rooms are small but very practical clean with very comfortable beds modern bath and a safe there is a place in the inner court to sit down and relax for more active visitors there is a very nice size indoor swimming pool in the basement i would guess about 15m length and a steam room both open daily till 2230 bath robes and slippers provided we have not tried the breakfast this hotel will be definitely on my list when visiting paris againwe had a wonderful stay at les jardins de mademoiselle the receptionists were very friendly the room was very clean and modern theres also a beautiful spa and a nice small garden and terrasse which gives the place a very cosy feel to it plus we felt very safe in this neighbourhoodstayed one night with family at the last minute staff were kind and informative loved the pool steam room and rooftop garden the dinner recommendation was spot on the room was recently renovated beds were comfortable and showers spotless we would give 10 stars if we couldthe hotel is very welcoming with an excellent spa and terrace overlooking a typical paris internal courtyard the breakfast is adequate but there is very very little space between the tables the large double room was adequately furnished and had a very small balcony overlooking the rue de mademoisellewe stayed in the family room which was 2 adjoining rooms our room was clean comfortable modern and had all the necessities we needed the rooms were amazingly quiet  even with the adjoining rooms we never heard anyone in the other room no tv sounds etc each day we were left with 2 bottles of water turn down service at night and excellent cleaning service the room has a good hair dryer and shampoo soap etc the  hotel and rooms also have ac which was definitely needed in july  the staff at les jardins de madamoiselle were all over the top in their customer service they were helpful as we planned our days attentive to every need very friendly polite and accommodating we arrived very early and they worked to get us in our room that morning offering us coldspent 2 nights and 3 days here 2 adults and 2 children and really loved it reception staff are very friendly and helpful boys really enjoyed the pool and we enjoyed the spa happy hour was more like happy 4 hours and the garden and roof terrace are a great place to relax at the end of a busy day we had an interconnecting room which was very modern and well equipped hotel is a 5 minute uber ride from the eiffel tower and big shopping mall a 10 minute walk plenty of restaurants and cafes within minutes will definitely go backa very nice hotel great stuff clean quiet place amazing service the pool was excellent clean warm breakfast  fantastic everything was to perfection the area around the hotel full of cosy cafes and restaurantswe stay in august with our family the pool and roof top deck was wonderful to relax at the end of a long day the neighborhood had many great restaurants when we go back to paris we will definitely stay here againmy mother and i visited paris in july 2019 to see the sights as one does we stayed in les jardins de madamoiselle for 3 nights and were happily suprised by the quality of the accommodation and facilities the swimming pool was just long enough for lengths and the steam room was warm and comfortable the gym left a little to be desired but considering it was in the basement of a relatively small hotel it was still a nice facility to have the rooms themselves were modern clean and comfortable if a little small the air con was efficient and quiet the shower was powerful and most rooms command a lovely view over either the street or interior garden my mum was especially pleased to be able to see the eiffel tower from her suite on the top floor the hotel is situated neari happened to find les jardins de mademoiselle doing a search on expedia  i am so glad i booked this amazing hotel  we stayed here for a weekend but i was so impressed by the staff location and the facilities  the hotel is within a 10 minute walk to cambronne station and right around the corner from a bus stop  you are near several brasseries patisseries grocery stores etc  this is a very quiet area at night so if you like being off the beaten path then this is the place  the staff were amazingly helpful in every way  the breakfast has some very delicious choices or you are close to other breakfast options  the pool area reminds me of a hotel in zermatt switzerland where i have stayed  our uber drivers didnt even realize it was a hotel because it has the look of amy wife and i had an excellent stay at the hotel this is one of the best hotel we stayed we travel around the world often and find the staff is friendly and want to make sure our stay is comfortable in particular sofia she paid attention to all the details to make sure we are well taken care of during our visit the location is excellent close to metro nice restaurant and eiffel tower and also other attractions they have a pool and spa that is world class make you relax after a days work i would give a five star ratingi stayed at les jardins de mademoiselle for my girlfriends 21st birthday the

location spa facilities are also very nice i wouldnt change anything about the stay and i would highly recommend this hotelwe were delighted by this hotel in the 15th arrondissement of paris its very close to the commerce metro station but still located in a quieter residential part of the city so there were very few tourists and no crowds adorable shops around the corner with plenty of great local bistros and cafes for dinnerdrinks in the evenings if you dont want to stray far from the hotel  the hotel itself is beautiful comfortable nicely appointed and clean delicious robust breakfast offered in the mornings both the courtyard gardens and the rooftop terrace offer fabulous locations for a breakfast coffee or an evening glass of bordeaux which they sell at the bar in a quiet classically parisian setting their kind helpful englishspeaking staff that really made our stayhad a wonderful stay at this hotel the front desk staff were super helpful from giving restaurant

Libertel Austerlitz Jardin des Plantes,this hotel is really nice and close to every facility metro shops restaurants with only one stop of metro u are in notre damevery clean hotel very nice and helpful staff i really enjoyed my stay in this hotel which is really cheap compared to all other hotels and what it offers the only thing i didnt like is that theres no wardrobe but its not really necessaire if u stay for a short time i would recommend this hotel and if i come back to paris i will certainly book here againwhen you first see the tiny entrance to the hotel set between the street cafs of paris you think this could be interesting however once you enter you are greeted by a clean modern interior compared to the old facade of the street  the room we stayed in was tiny by our standards however this is the only hotel we have stayed at in paris so this may be normal the metro and commuter rail stations are very close  definitely check with the hotel if you are not able bodied as things are cramped and the elevators seem to only go to half levels which means you have to use at least one flight of stairs our only issues were the tiny shower which did not seal properly so a fair bit of the water we used ended up on the floor the walls are very thin so if your neighbours make athis hotel offers a basic but reasonable accommodation at a very good location suitable to explore paris on foot or by subway the rooms are quite small but very clean and newly renovated everything is contemporary we had a triple room with safe small fridge teapot and coffee machine the value for the money is not excellent but decent the staff was polite and helpfulvery convenient location subway train  jardin des plantes for a morning jogging clean staff very nice delicious and various breakfast with very good  fresh products for a reasonable price 10excellent location  super tiny little room better read the measurements before you pay  the staff are very steuben i still cant believe they dont know anything near the hotel  provide the wrong information for the airport bus overall is oki was here for only one night  hotel is very close to the train stationthats why i chose it the room was for only one personroom for a double bed seperate bath room very small  but very clean close to shopsthe staff was very welcoming and friendly they spoke english the room was comfortable and clean very close proximity easy walking distance to the gare dausterlitz and the metro the metro station entrance is about 30 steps from the front door also not too far from notre dame a bit of a walk but completely manageable breakfast was great would stay here again  a word of advice it took a few tries before we realized that the shower door actually goes inward at first we thought it was impossible to get into the shower until we realized this not sure all rooms showers are like this but if yours is now you knowthis hotel was chosen primarily for the close location of the railway stations gare dausterlitz and gare de lyon  it suited our needs and excelled in both the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff  the cleanliness of the rooms were faultless  a great stopoverstayed here for 3 nights was a great hotel location to metro 2 min walk which is perfect location to get around all the wonderful spots in paris room was spotless however it was somewhere on the small side and not much room however would definitely return  nice friendly staff alsogreat hotel good location helpful english speaking staff the room is a little small but has all you need  it has a fridge which is a big bonus i would certainly stay there again when visiting parisstaff were lovely check in was easy and the cleaners did an amazing job every day location was perfect couldnt get much better  across the road from a train and metro station restaurants next to it and 2 minute walk away from the canal to say it was on a main road you couldnt hear much traffic noise however i will say the walls are extremely thin so you can hear everything your neighbor is doing and everyone walking up and down the lobby we had a cosy double so we were expecting it to be small the bed area wasnt as small as i was expecting however the bathroom was tiny me and my partner didnt have an issue with this but if you are a bigger person you wouldnt fair well trying to have a shower if this is the case i would highly recommend getting a bigger roomthe hotel is fantastic clean and tidy the area is very well connected  the breakfast amazing a lot of choice sweet and savoury i highly recommend this hotel my next time will be certainly here good jobthis hotel was chosen primarily for the close location of the railway stations gare dausterlitz and gare de lyon  it suited our needs and

very good hotel to stay it is very close to the metro bus and train stations and there are the gardens very close by the national natural history museum is just around the corner i recommend the hotel to everyone the breakfast is a bit poor for 10 eurosa no frills hotel convenient for rail from austerlitz and metro  also near to jardin des plantesnearby seine to stretch the legs after travel  comfortable bed and good shower  which is all we wanted  rooms are a bit small but this is paris  double bed is accessible only from one side which may be a problem for some and the bathroom may be a little tight for anyone above average sizethis hotel had everything we needed and i i cant really fault it  the bedrooms are well packed and the bathrooms have sliding doors not actual doors despite some reviews commenting on this i do not believe it impax on the hotels rating staff are very welcoming and will happily help you if you have any questions my only issue is not with the hotel just with the location which cannot be helped is the lack of food establishments me and my friend did find a little corner shop to the right when you exit the hotel which had some snacks but we did actually order a deliveroo to the hotel on the first night my only criticism would be that the hotel offer more bottled water and milk instead of cream for the tea and coffee facilitiesthe overall experience in this hotel left a lot to be desired  upon arrival to the hotel there was some confusion over payment the receptionist was rude and impatient and gave the impression she was not interested in what i had to say  after this we entered the hotel room which was not clean and had dirty cups under the bed as well as general dirt especially in the bathroom we soon realised when using the shower that water would leak out onto the floor completely flooding the room i went to report this to management and was told they couldnt do anything about it at that time no reason given it was 3pm   the electricity went off one afternoon i went to speak to the receptionist who said they didnt know what had happened and didnt have an estimated time iti stayed at this hotel for a night when i had to go to orleans the next day and stayed for a night while returning from orleans since there is a direct train from austerlitz station for paris to orleans i decided to stay at this hotel   the hotel is nice and is a 5 minute walk away from austerlitz station the hotel room was on the 5th floor both the times the staff was quite friendly there are very good eateries nearby and a jardin des plantes garden next to it if i travel to paris again or if i have to visit orleans again i would probably stay at this hotel againa lovely hotel right opposite the gare dausterlitz so perfect for anyone using the station or wanting to stay in this area the hotel was clean  reception staff were helpful and efficient room was small but well organised very comfortable bed good shower plus teacoffee making facilities and a free bottle of water well stocked buffet breakfast i would happily stay here againtwo couple staying one night en route the hotel has an inconspicuous entrance which if arriving by car is hard to spot staff were very friendly and helpful s we arrived earlier than expected our rooms were very nice and bed comfortable the breakfast room was not great but the breakfast itself was very good the nearest bars and restaurants are not good and the area like much of paris dirty and unkempt for a hotel so close to the centre at this price it was very goodnice hotel not far from the centre of paris the rooms are a not so big  good for a stay for 1 or 2 days the staff is very friendly and evrthing is nice and clean  we are coming back next yearwhen we visit the whisky fairthe hotel is very easy to find as it is located very close to the austerlitz train station and the metro lines 5 and 10 the downside is that the rooms are a bit noisy i had a room facing the boulevard and the metro line  the room itself was clean not very large but ok for paris standards the bathroom was very nice both rooms offered great large windows so everything was very light and not humid at all which is very nice for a bathroom  the staff was welcoming and nice  disabled travelers might want to avoid staying on the top floor as the elevator does not stop to the 5th floor only to the 4th so there are a few steps to climba great location within within walking distance to public transport the staff were friendly and very accommodating esp since we didnt speak french and the breakfast each morning was great the room was comfortable with great aircon perfect for weary travellersnice and very close to the station nothing else to add room is well furnished and clean service is cheerful  its a great starting point for a lot of trips down the best part of paris not muchmore  to add reallyit is clean  the location is great for the train but until the remodeling is done the noise  pounding is unbearable the bed  pillows were hard  the superior room was very small the staff apologized for the noise what can they doi chose this hotel because of its location directly in front of the austerlitz train and underground metro station  made my visit very convenient  easy walk along the river seine to notre dame 20 minutes  louvre 40 minutes eiffel tower 55 minutes there is also a supermarket a minutes walk away for snacks  drinks or essentials you may need  not to mention all the restaurants to choose from  as for the hotel i booked the double comfort room for 6 nights  i had room 402 which was nice  i returned for another 1 night stay on my way back from visiting the loire valley  had booked the double comfort room again  this time i was put in room 102  this was not even comparable to the first room i had  very very small and i was very very disappointed  worried to even open my,Hotel offers a basic but reasonable accommodation at a very good location suitable to explore paris on foot or by subway the rooms are quite small but very clean and newly renovated everything is contemporary. The value for the money is not excellent but decent the staff was polite and helpfulvery convenient location subway train  jardin des plantes for a morning jogging clean staff.
Libertel Gare de l'Est Francais,the policy of the hotel must be more flexible i came at 10 am and i asked for early check in and the receptionist said there is available room at 11 am but i have to pay 30 euros more or i have to wait until 2 pm this is actually first time to face like this situation most respective hotels are flexible for 2 or 3 hours and gain the customers satisfaction even if that against the internal rulesnice large rooms with minibars and good comfort beds  bathrooms are large enough and all is well done and recently done  this stay i had a large room on top with a mini balcony which had great views  the only issue is that there is construction work across the street and that makes a lot of noise from 7amnice clean hotel close to subway and train station ideal for travelers  helpful personal and supermarket next door romm is equipped with coffee machine and small fridge which was grandly appreciated    in summer day to keep some water fresh when coming back in the roomthe hotel is cozy and clean we stayed with our 5 months old baby  back then  the rooms were very comfortable and the hotel has a great location  close to subway   staff were very polite and friendly  will definitely consider going back and recommending to friends visiting paristhe hotel is cozy and clean we stayed with our 5 months old baby  back then  the rooms were very comfortable and

martin close by lots of nice restaurants and cafes nearby like holybelly the 10th arrondissement has some the best local food spots the area can get a little rough at night but that seems to be the case outside most main train stations would recommendi have been staying at this hotel for a few years now and never had a problem it is opposite gare de lest and within walking distance to gare du nord so if you are going to take the train there it is perfect the rooms are quiet and clean and fit their description so if you are by yourself a small room is fine and if you need more space you should book a slightly more expensive larger room a strict covid19 protocol is followed and you feel entirely safe  i really recommend this hotel if you are looking for a clean convenient and safe place to staywhen i arrived that day i got stuck because no metro runs to gare de lest hikkssbut with all of my euphoria on my holiday in paris i can escape from the stuck and the stranded at chatelet metro station getting down from metro line 14 who runs without driver luckily it is easy to find police around i asked the way to go to gare de lest and in fact its very very easy just turn right and walk straight along the main street until end thanks god that the libertel gare de lest hotel just few meters after the bk wow very near and easy to find   first when i arrived at the hotel i feel so tired but the receptionist mr shamim is really kind welcome and helpful and because after got a hard time by the metro strike i suddenly feel safe in this hotel and comfortablerecommendation i would only recommend this hotel if 1 your are coming late and leaving early because your main priority is something close to paris gare de lest station and 2 you live in a big city and are used to or not bothered by lots of noise   room i paid for the bigger room supposedly for two when i walked in i figured they must have made a mistake and given me the small room for one but no this was the big room i dont want to know how small the small room was that said it was clean the bed was fine the bathroom large and had a very nice soaking tub      not so good stuff broken acheather i couldnt even get the fan to come on they offered to move me to a different room but it would have been closer to the street and even more noisy than this onei felt instantly welcomed by the lovely staff who constantly worked on improving our stay the rooms were nice and quiet even though cleaning could have been slightly better during the days overall the room was very nice and romantic perfect for couplesi have

to queue for ages to speak to someone as theres only ever one person on the counter   the hotel itself is small and basic the rooms are like your standard travelodge except smaller and perhaps more

bath and room there seemed an ant hole in the corner of the bath i told the counter and they changed my room to where smaller than before and heating system was not working i told the counter but they just let me wait so i had to wait till the last of my staying in coldness the man who came to my room for checking heater smelled terrible so i had to open a window in midnight to let fresh air in also i found the cup i used at the first day still remained till the last day of may staying   never recommend this hotelthank you we had a lovely stay breakky was yummy and was close to everything

and plugged it back in and it worked the heating is up to high but thats ok cause we turned it down and open the windowit was the second time i stayed in this hotel my first experience helped pick it up for the second time and i would gladly go back anytime it is a very clean and comfortable hotel close to all means of transportation with stores and restaurants around and kind and helpful staffthe hotel rooms have been renovated recently and are much improved the location is superb for those arriving by train to gare de lest the staff especially shamim reflected the mixture of professionalism and friendliness that is always valued in a good hotel the booking rates when booked and paid in advance are very competitive for the city of paris and the minibar can double as a place to keep your drinks cool this is a very good choice for parisi stayed here prior to taking a train from gare de lest to strasbourg gare de lest is literally steps away from this hotel   so i went there the night before my departure to see what the layout and procedure for boarding was and also used the convenient atm and small but good grocery store there there are various shops and cafes there too  when i first arrived to the hotel i was about 2 hours early before check in and was really tired because i had taken an overnight flight from the us got a ride to the opera area from the airport dropped some luggage at another location there and walked 20 blocks to the libertel hotel  when i arrived the front desk staff shamim made me feel welcome showed me where i could temporarily store my lugage and

was clean  adequate for us with tea coffee facilities mini fridge  safe breakfast very nice with decent varietyi have been 1 night with my familylocation was very good just 5 min to gare du nord and front of gare du estthe reception desk and lobby was extra small and tiny my trippe room was smaller than what l saw at pictures and what expected the bathroom was modern and supr cleani stayed here for 1 night in a comfort room the room was compact but had everything needed and plenty of surfaces  hangers everything was really clean the bed was excellent  very comfortable memory foam i think  the bathroom was very small but again very clean and the shower good good size shower cubicle and also enough surface space to put toiletries breakfast was well stocked and had variety the location is really good to get around from there was some noise from the metro but i think earplugs would easily block it out rooms at the back dont have any traffic noise  id definitely stay here again for a short break staff were very helpful and rooms very comfortable  modernmy daughter and i spent 1 night here on the recommendation of a friend we were not disappointed the hotel is situated less than 10 mins walk from gard du nord station although our phone map sent us on the wrong route on arrival and we found ourselves in a not too desirable area we didnt make this mistake on our return trip that said there are many quite intimidating characters that hang around gard du nord trying to sell cigarettes etc we simply ignored them i dont think wed have done the journey after dark the hotel is lovely and simple and perfect for a mini break reception is clean smart and inviting we arrived around 1130am and were advised our room would be ready at 2pm so we placed our bags in the luggage room and set off for the metro to start our tour ofi keep coming back to this hotel over and over and get the same receptionist  very good service   worth the cash that you spend aswell if only there were offers for frequent clients  haha  p   you wont regretroom was clean  staff was very friendly and location is great check in was planned at 1400 but at 1200 the front desk lady avana was able to find me a room  you have restaurants and shops everywhere arround the hotelexcellent hotel close to gare du nord and gare lest easy walking distance  good staff and services good rooms close to convenience stores restaurants and banks  the price while not cheap is good value for moneymy husband and i didnt stayed too long in paris however we felt that the stay was wonderful we had top floor and room was spacious and clean toilet was clean and space is just right down part was the tv is a little small and all are french channels however the sound proofing was quite good when people walked past we can hardly hear anything however the main point is the location is good and within 23 mins walk to metro there are supermarkets and restaurants beside the hotel,nice large rooms with minibars and good comfort beds  bathrooms are large enough and all is well done and recently done  this stay i had a large room on top with a mini balcony which had great views  the only issue is that there is construction work across the street and that makes a lot of noise from 7amnice clean hotel close to subway and train station ideal for travelers.
Little Palace Hotel,the hotel is on a small beautiful unknown square right next to the cnam on the right bank close to grand boulevard st martin areas and super accessible from the gare du nord or montparnasse via the line 4   ive stayed here several times and always had a really nice view of the square   the staff is very welcoming and competentthe little palace hotel as its name suggests is small the rooms are quite tiny and there isnt much if any closet space but it wonderfully located and a beautiful spot if youre looking for a grand hotel this isnt for you but if you are looking for a nice little room to relax in when youre not walking the city i highly recommend this hotel i dont think it would be large enough for two people but for one it is enough room the staff was very helpful and kind and its minutes from wonderful shops and cafes i will definitely come back my personal favorite was the small terrace where i took my coffee in the morningthe perfect hotel to me in paris as

the staff were very friendly and helpful  our room was stunning and had a lovely patio area with chairs to sit and relax in although in feb it was too cold but in the summer i imagine it would be

functioned well we had a nice view toward the park square and it was lovely staff was nice and attentive hotel was reasonably priced considering paris and its location close to marais we tried the hotel breakfast and it had decent options all in all it was a pleasant staythe hotel itself is what id expect from a paris establishment  small and old the foyer area is lovely and the room we stayed in overlooked a park which can be quite noisy at times the room was pretty small but thats paris location is great  10 minute walk to the river close to the metro and plenty attractions close bythe room was small and the bathroom was tiny and all was a bit dated but the value was good the location was awesome the subway was super convenient the bed was comfortable we did not try their breakfast the water was hot and the pressure was good the staff was awesome they spoke very good english and were very friendly and personablethis is a small but friendly hotel whose selling point is its location it is in the 4th arrondisement and within walking distance of lots of shops bars and restaurants and right next door to the reaumur sebastopol metro stop on line 4 this is just one stop from chatelet les halles and the rer line b which is a direct regional train to cdg airport the hotel itself overlooks a small square and is on a side streetsquare just off two main roads which means there wasnt as much traffic noise plus excellent blackout curtains mean that it was easy to sleep all the staff we encountered were polite friendly and keen to help and please the rooms themselves are small but contain everything youd need and were very cleantop floor up to floor 8 rooms have the best views as doroom very small but standard for paris furniture were old and stained walls  bathroom remember to bring your own shampoo cream etc no facilities and just a very old hairdryer  cleaning found hair on the bed and in the bathroom not impressed  breakfast for 15 euros i just recommend go somewhere else  staff kind and helpful location excellent in walking distance to central paris and many restaurants  conclusion we are not coming backwe had a lovely stay at this hotel location is good and the room was nice reception staff were friendly and helpful the foyer had such a lovely scent from the beautiful flowers that were there would definately stay againwe stayed here for 4 nights and to be honest could have stayed alot longer  location wise this hotel was perfect and had loads of bars and shops within walking distance  the staff were very friendly and helpful  our room was stunning and had a lovely patio area with chairs to sit and relax in although in feb it was too cold but in the summer i imagine it would be perfect room 57  the only downside to our stay was that there wasnt any teacoffee making facilities and there wasnt much storage  i would definitely recommend this placevery pleasant stay at the little palace hotel friendly staff nice rooms and good breakfast nice surroundings such as lovely park with fountain at the opposite of the hotel close to nice restaurants and shopping areas such as the maraisi had searched to find a reasonably priced hotel on this area as we were on a tour that ended near here what a nice surprise to discover the little palace hotel the location is convenient for walking or riding the metro  we had a lovely room on the top floor overlooking the park very comfortable and clean bathroom wasnt large but that is what is expected in european hotels the front desk was very pleasant and helpful with directions  the breakfast may not be worth 15 euro but we had a rate that included it and it was fine i would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friendswhere do i start created an account just to make this review i booked 25 months ahead of time and got a decent rate of 1303usd for 4 nights in the suite definately not a suite which is why ive put it in quotations we stayed at nh collection in rome immediately prior to this in the panorama suite now that is a suite and i miss it already i cant imagine the unfortunate people who have gotten smaller rooms as im sure their experience is worse   1 the noise you can hear absolutely everything my neighbors upstairs stay up until 1 or 2 every night and you can hear all the footsteps and heavy creaks with the old wood it sounds like a walrus moving furniture they also get up early so that means no good sleep for you you can also hear their coughs it sounds likewe stayed 3 nights here and the rooms were clean and the beds were great staff was nice and friendly we had a little balcony overlooking the park below which was awesome i missed having a little coffee andor tea station in the room though as it would have been nice to enjoy a morning coffee in the room without having to go to the reception to buy one also a flat iron would have been nice the breakfast was not worth the 15 euros but we just went elsewhere to get breakfast neighborhood is fantastic with a metro right next to the hotel all in all id come back to stay here i just think a 4 star hotel needs that little extra i booked little palace hotel as part of the british airways sale package for my girlfriends birthday trip to paris this was our first stay in paris and the hotel seemed to be a good option considering the price per night for the location   the staff are extremely friendly whether it be the receptionconcierge who speak a variety of languages or the catererscleaners for instance they helped with directions and recommendations for restaurants etc  however upon arrival when we checked in and went up to our room we unexpectedly opened the door to one of the hotels handymen who was just as surprised as us reception had evidently failed to notify either of us so we had to wait outside our room for 10 mins or so whilst he finished initially this did not bother us toostaff is super nice  rooms are super cramped no natural light breakfast is not included very sneaky about this  this is not an inexpensive hotel but it sure felt like it  no way to call front desk no restaurant rooms are very different  im not one to post  good or bad  but i was kind of shocked at how this 500night hote felt like a hostel  too bad marais neighborhood is awesome thoughwe booked a superior double room with a balcony our room faced the front of the hotel and we had a magnificent view from the balcony of paris it was breathe taking our room was a good size for two adults and   it was very clean and so old world charm  and beauty the staff was very friendly and most helpful with all of our questions or concerns the location was perfect very close to all tourist attractions centre of the city if you choose to have their breakfast you are provided with a lovely variety of choices it is simply delicious highly recommendedfirst i booked myself into this hotel on bookingcom and regretted that i stayed in there second and last time i again booked myself in there totally by mistake hopefully there will not be a third one it is a small cozy hotel  way too cozy  matresses  bed sheets and comforters are old and not very comforting good for vloggers and backpackers but i can not tell the same thing if you are on bizz or pleasure tripa nice old cozy paris hotel with good location lovely view of small green area with fountain we already felt welcome in the lobby beautiful bar and invitting breakfast room very friendly and helpfull staff the only thing we could have wanted was a little more closet space in the roomsuch a cute boutique hotel and staff are friendly close to a metro and only half hour walk to the louvre clean and very comfortable  recommend getting a taxi from the station if coming off from the eurostar because even though the hotel was in a nice area round by the station felt a little unsafemy teenage daughter and i stayed at this hotel for three nights in april the staff was really friendly and helpful we felt very welcomed the room small but clean and instagram friendly with nice decor and a small balcony viewing the park quiet and safe neighborhoodexcellent hotel amazing location clean rooms and great service the view from the room was extraordinary we will definitely return to this hotel there is a metro station nearby but we preferred to walkthis is my second time at the little palace hotel  im a creature of habit especially in far and away places  i feel like i have a home here when in paris and that is because of the great location and furthermore the staff  for the second year in a row i got to deal with mamoud who is very friendly  the rest of the staff are great as well including the lovely ladies from housekeeping who wait downstairs with a smile as you remove the do not disturb tag and head outdoors  i get exceptional rest at this hotel as it is nice and quiet  and for the location youre in a great place with wonderful views from your room  when i visit paris this is now my home,the hotel is on a small beautiful unknown square right next to the cnam on the right bank close to grand boulevard st martin areas and super accessible from the gare du nord or montparnasse via the line 4. We had a superior room on 6th floor overlooking the pretty park and with a balcony although there are busy roads nearby the double glazing cuts out the traffic noise no kettle in room but they were very happy to send up a pot of boiling water for us to make tea.
Maison Souquet,the location is already outstanding just around the corner from a myriad of restaurants bars and transport options once you cross the threshold youre transported to another time where the velvetcushioned furniture and the low lights bring the parisian spirit to bloom the service and staff are outstanding both during checkin and for amenities the private hammam and pool provide a cocoon to be enjoyed in total calm and the rooms are lavishly decorated an extra note on the comfort of the mattress bravoi spent several nights at the maison souquet its a genuine full of soul stylish and beautiful historic place the staff was so helpful professional and at our service the private pool is always an unforgettable peaceful experience for everyone last but not least the hotel

effortless attention to detail yet relaxed atmosphere is a dream combination  their ability to organise things for you and take care of everything was amazing  special place special teamcant wait to

along with soft furnishing everywhere creates a real sense of intimacy  the welcoming and accommodating staff were excellent and the outstanding cocktails dont hurt comfortable and beautiful rooms as wellexcellent twonight stay on my honeymoon beautiful and unique with excellent service the cocktail bar and complimentary one hour visit to the private pool and steamroom are excellent perks  its in a touristy area around the corner from the moulin rouge but it is only a short walk from the views dining and nightlife of montmartre  i would definitely recommend this hotel to an american couple visiting parisone of the very best hidden places in paris with everything from a historical vibe to a very friendly service also it is located close to a lot of nice restaurants and cultural experiences in paris i booked to stay at the hotel as a surprise for my wifes 50th birthday in march 2020 but covid put a stop to that the staff have been fantastic in understanding that we couldnt get to the hotel we finally made it this august and what a treat it is seductive and stunning in equal measure the staff were attentive without being over bearing a 3 day break to remember we will be returninglet me tell you that ive experienced many hotels in my day from regular to luxury often im impressed not by the name but by the experience when i say that the staff at maison souquet blew me away they provided outstanding service that astonished me to space and im still there wondering about how ive been missing out in life until now  first booking this experience as an english speaker living in the midwest trying to make everything perfect for my husbands birthday trip to paris was easy yes youre reading that right easy easier than booking a hotel in chicago or anywhere in the us why you ask because their packages include everything you need before you even book once you book someone reaches out to you personally and confirms your booking details everywhat a wonderful experience made all the better by the incredible staff   it was a weekend to remember the spa is also perfect for undoing the sins from the night before best spent in the hotels incredible bar perfect for groups or couplesi came to stay at the hotel with some friends for a weekend it was wonderful the staff were so so helpful the room was lovely and the steam room and pool were perfect for a sunday morning relax it is a great location and i would definitely stay here againwe stayed at maison souquet this weekend and i cannot begin to describe how incredible the staff and the service was the team helped us get covid tests organized tests and travel documents printed they booked countless incredible experiences across the city for us i needed an adapter to charge my phone and they sent up 3 different options within 2 minutes breakfast was beautiful the spa was wonderful but it really was the people who made our stay wonderful whoever hired this team  i hope you are reading this and know how valuable they all are to this businessone of my best hotel experiences every detail was perfect staff service food pool rooms etc etc i highly recommend this place for any type of parisian stay the only thing missing is a inhouse restaurant but the area is well fitted with multiple choices of nice tables for all types of budgetsmy wife and i celebrated a big birthday and found the ideal hotel in paris it is very well located quiet street nearby the moulin rouge to explore montmartre and paris on foot great setup with its own pool  hammam and very friendly staff highly recommendedduring our last stay in paris  we stayed at this wonderful boutique hotel for a weekend next to montmartre  the service and our room margot were both exquisite the decor overall is superb the team was welcoming and helpful when needed they assisted us perfectly on our first night we had a lovely dinner with delicious cocktails at the hotel bar order the dita the next day we enjoyed a walk in the neighbourhood typical charming paris and came back for a session in the private spa followed by massages which i honestly recommend to everyone staying at the hotel amazing in every aspect we had a great time at la maison souquet and hope to return soon,maison souquet is a beautiful boutique establishment located just across from the mouline rouge so superconvenient for accessing paris both on foot and by metro. Private hammam and pool provide a cocoon to be enjoyed in total calm and the rooms are lavishly decorated. salon deau was a treat wonderful treatment and some great time in complete privacy.
Melia Paris Vendome,some hits first the location is good with lots of high end shops nearby and many attractions in walking distance the bar staff are friendly and the bar is a pleasant place to sit and chat there is a kettle and tea and coffee in the room free wifi and good powerpoints the misses the air conditioning is either a steam bath or off the heated towel rail didnt work my room was badly designed particularly the wardrobe which was almost unusable and the safe was too hard to access the room key system is unreliable and my key didnt work most of the time breakfast is a complete shambles  the staff rush around but do nothing useful the omelette lady appears very infrequently and often not at all the range of offerings is only adequate they need to lift their game one dayits hard to find good value hotels in the centre of paris and the melia paris vendome is not one of them in my opinion  others have commented on the less than welcoming receptionists  also when we visited the lobby was being renovated the rooms are small but functional the location is however fantastic just by the tuileries  the main reason i chose this one was because of the swimming pool that was advertised on the website but actually it doesnt exist and when i pointed this out to the receptionist he shrugged his shoulders in the great offhand parisian tradition   i see this reference to a pool has now been deleted from their website so maybe i was listened to   better to stay in the suburbs or get an air bnb and spend what youve saved on metro tickets andhotel is tucked close to the jardin des toiletries and a short walk to the musee dorsay breakfast each day was included and the selection and staff were wonderful we also enjoyed dinner just around the corner at maison da rosa per the front desk staff recommendationi got an email from the hotel a day after checkout asking for payment for several drinks in the in room mini bar that i didnt drink i returned the email letting them know i didnt take any drinks from the bar and i wouldnt pay for them if they changed it to my credit cardthe melia paris vendome is very elegant hotel and it is well situated for people to use the public transportation system for sightseeing or just exploring the city itself i would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friendsit was not a great time to visit one of the worlds beat cities as the yellow vest riots were in full swing the museums stores banks and metro were all closed as were most cafes the melia vendoms excellent service comfort and amenities made our trip truly memorable additionally the hotel provided security and the few times we walked a few blocks the concierge would go with usclose to the louvre one block to the metro and centrally located to get you anywhere you need to go  the hotel is very nice the rooms are a bit small but not in european terms  the people are extremely helpful and the entire hotel is very clean and inviting  i would definitely consider staying there againi travel to paris often for work tagging on personal leisure time around work commitments where feasible and booked the melia on this occasion even though i had prearranged the detail of the booking both through my work travel agent and a phone call prior to arrival on arrival they insisted on an additional charge of 80 euros for 2 of my 3 nights no customer service whatsoever just simply i dont know who you spoke to our system says this  i should have read some of the negative reviews on here as there are consistent themes of opportunistic over charging bad service and subpar basic facilities expected for even a 3 star hotel never mind a hotel classing themselves as a 4 star  the king bed was actually 2 singles pushed together which did not make forlocation location location in the most exclusive are of paris near a metro station and with walking distance to place vendome louvre concorde st honore opera etc very cozy hotel with a good serviceexcellent place for shopping walking distance to all branded stuff and restaurants  cafes  the room decoration is old design and some of the rooms needs repair lighting tried to get a taxi from the reception but could not help with all sorts of reasons  asked 1 day beforeon the plus side the location is good  however without a doubt this hotel has the worst beds  just imagine sleeping on an ironing board and that gives you the picture of the hotels cheap mattresses and couple that with pillows equally as hard  the hotel also makes sure it gets every dime out of their towels as there was simply no nap  check out was a 20minute nightmare as it took the clerk 4 print outs to get our bill right  there are definitely other hotels far better in this areamy wife and i stayed here while visiting paris staff was courteous and attentive room was very clean and the location is central to all top attractions i cant see enough about the staff they were always willing to help with any questions and they did it with a smile we would defiantly stay here againwe made melia vendome our home for a 9 day paris vacation first the service across the board was fabulous  all staff were friendly attentive and lightening quick with any request we were welcomed by the manager on two separate occasions with champagne and macaroons we had a junior suite on the first floor really the second floor that had two separate rooms and two bathrooms bed was great street noise was not an issue we used our sound app at night and the daily hustle and bustle of a paris street was to be expected having the breakfast included in our rate was a great choice the location is the best anywhere across paris eating at flottes and le souffle as well as the vendome bar made this stay feel like we were in our own paris neighborhood  we will returnoverall our experience was very good  there were a few minor glitches however  my wife and i stayed for our 25th anniversary  after arriving we paid extra to upgrade our room  while the room was bigger it faced into the air shaft in the center and had noise from the elevator  not particularly romantic  we asked for a new room the next day and were given a room facing front on the top floor which was much better  i wish we could have had that from the start but was glad to get it for part of the stay    i think the hotel does need a dedicated concierge to help with guest needs and requests  it would be helpful for transportation to the airport for day trips and other informationthis hotel is nicely located the area is easy to navigate and its pretty safe sadly it ends there  the breakfast is mediocre the service is hit and miss one day can be amazing and the next just horrible which unfortunately for them could have earned them 5 stars despite their limitations if the service has remained good and constant  we stayed 3 nights with 2 kids  at our arrival antonio was amazing and ronald at the restaurant was really consistently good in fact great amazing with the kids and really helpful the second morning he was not there was entirely different the service was horrible and it was as if the staff did not want to be there as soon as ronald arrived he took care of us amazingly  on our second day we arrived at 6 pm with 2 exhausted children tothe hotel is in a great location about 2 minutes walk from the metro they service is decent although i feel they can improve on this the was a problem with the heating for one night but other than that my stay was really good would definitely recommendwhat a wonderful location to explore paris and also so convenient for the metro  everyone was so kind and helped us find the police station to register my husbands stolen wallet  take care on the metro  there is lots to do and see and there are excellent restaurants in the area  the staff were really attentive and kinda smaller hotel within walking distance of pariss major attractions and shopping  staff is very friendly and helpful to all your needs  rooms are large and well appointed but can use some updating  a very positive experience overallmy daughter and i spent a full week at this lovely hotel  front desk was incredibly friendly and most helpful staff was also very friendly  our room was on the second floor corner one with a small but really lovely bathroom with wonderful body lotion shampoo conditioner shower gel and hand soap products not mini sizes but full ones  breakfast was very nice not your typical or average continental breakfast i truly enjoyed it  we had dinner a couple of times and it was really delicious  overall the hotel is a little jewel nestled in the heart of the luxury shopping area which made shopping easier for us i absolutely recommend this hotel its worth itvery good situated close to the louvre in the fashion district  very attentive staff  cool design  old school art deco  rooms are a bit small but cosy  good linen nice breakfast  spanish speaking this hotel has a wonderful location near the louvre  the staff spoke good english and were very helpful we were there during some of the yellow vest demonstrations which caused an issue with getting a taxi to the airport however the staff went to the end of the block spoke to the policeman who was standing there and the taxi was allowed to pass the metro was within an easy walk  there were restaurants and shops nearby some of which are quite pricey  dior chanel etc  the room was not large but it had a microwave an inroom safe and a good sized bathroom  the elevator was the size of a postage stamp and had difficulty accommodating two people with suitcases but we managed  we were towards the fron of the hotel so we had some street noise if we opened the windowshown to a room already occupied much to my horror second room was dingy tired and toilet did not flush properly view was depressing could not get hold of room service for a bottle of water was not informed about breakfast or any other facilities and there was no information in room and had even paid to upgrade my roomthis hotel is nicely located the area is easy to navigate and its pretty safe sadly it ends

very safe area  easy access to metro and busesthe minerve hotel is perfectly located 5min walk to two metro stations and 10min to iledecite notre dame the room was very clean and the bed very comfortable we had a balcony which was very nice the room is quite small 11qm incl bathroom which is normal for paris we didnt expected the bathroom to only have a glassdoor as a couple that was ok but if you travel with friends it would better to have more privacyconsidering this is a 3 star hotel in paris the rooms are the expected sizebut furnished well and a nice touch of painting the sky on our ceiling which made the room feel light and bigger  teacoffee facilities were neat and the bathroom had a shower in the bath and we used both again no complaints staff were friendly and spoke excellent english location suited us as we were there to meet friends and family just round the corner it was also better value than some of the local 3 star alternatives would stay again if in the

of the year  pricing is really good  i couldnt find anything to complain aboutyes the rooms are small but perfectly formed full of character clean and comfortable and the location is perfect in the lain quarter surrounded by bars and restaurants we especially liked bon vivant close enough to many attractions and metro stations which is very easy to use cant comment on the food as we ate out all the time but all in all a great hotel and we would stay here againwe come here for years every year cause of good location nice rooms some too small and too small bathrooms breakfast was even better befor  no fresh fruits  friendly staff all very clean we will come again  as paris loves usthis hotel needs sound proofing  dont stay here if you want sleepyou hear everybody talking in all rooms around youall the tvs when someone has a shower and other thingsneeds fridge in rooms alsoroom was good apart from that and comfy bedswould not of been able to have 2 suitcases in room only room to open onevery nice staff  absolutely perfect  unfortunately the elevator bedrooms and bathrooms are almost not big enough to fit 2 people inside  especially with luggage breakfast is reallly poor in diversity all in all is very well located and its clean  no shower caps available  which makes no sense with the price charged for the tiny rooms  smells nicefriendly staff and a great place to use as a base to explore paris  located in latin quarter and very convenient to restaurants and older areas for exploring  close to several metro stops that get you around the city and to the airport and train stationsthis is a nice tradtional paris hotel with a relaxed atmosphere friendly staff and the smallest lift ive experienced although the room was typically small this is paris my daughter and i enjoyed the immaculate cleanliness comfortable beds and quiet nights our room was wellheated but we could also open the window a critical feature and sadly lacking in some modern hotels we loved the neighborhood and founds the perfect bakery with a few tables and serving coffee to have our breakfast nearby la parisienne the hotel breakfast was also good too and handy for sunday morningwe stayed for two nights for a short city trip perfect location comfortable stay nice personel reasonable price some nice bars and restaurants nearby easy to walk to stgermain panteon rue mouftard notre dameor maraisnice place to stay and convient in the latin quarter  small rooms and hard pillows is the down side price is good and so is the service rooms do have thin walls  heard the next door room on the phone at 5 amrooms too small tiny and dirty bathroom there was mold  on the shower floor and walls disgusting need better cleaning and care very noisy i could hear everything from others rooms which was very unpleasant bed not comfortable at all the room and corridors smell bad  wouldnt recommend this hotel to anyone the location does not compensate the bad experienceviva la parisbeautiful heart soaring ear pleasing tasty soft sky quiet friendly secure the people were kind and helpful easy to communicate with limited french language skills weather was perfectthis hotel was booked on line for our 3 day stay in paris upon our arrival from canada the hotel is centrally located close to the norte dame and siene river and within walking distance to numerous restaurants and cafes the staff was very friendly helpful and spoke english the buffet breakfasts was quite good as well  our room was quite small by canadian standards  for 2 people  but acceptable by europes standards the elevator was very small and it was not easy to fit 2 people with carry on luggage but we managed our room was fairly clean except if you looked under the bed it appeared the area was not vacuumed for an extended period  our bathroom which contained the typical toilet and shower stall was both small by canadian standards and offered little or nowe checked in at 7pm and greeted by a very rude lady there is only 1 tiny elevator that barely fits 2 people and a luggage the carpet smells like pee we ate breakfast buffet everything was cold and like eating in the dungeon will not stay here again for the price you can find a better placejust like buying real estate hotel location is important too  located near the metro lots of restaurants and cafes  front desk staff were very helpful we walked to the notre dame cathedral louvre musee dorsay and even the eiffel towerfrom here also there is a direct train to charles de galle airport from the notre dame metro stop would definitely recommend hotel minervevery good location walking distance to major attractions and less than 2 city blocks from the siene and less than 1 km to st michel place  clean room but too small for long stays and a couple bathroom wall was of glazed glass and not privatevery small  samll rooms are typical of paris but this was really ont he tiny side  hotel has other large rooms  breakfast was fine but could use some fress fruithotel staff were very welcoming very good accommodation and buffet breakfast good location near metro and walking distance to the river seine excellent location if traveling by eurostar into paris with 2 changes on the metro 31 minutes from the gare du nordexcellent hotel friently staff particularly mr victor good locationtwo blocks of seine clean hotel i would highly recommend it ideal for couples but also for family  very safe area  easy access to metro and buseseverything was excellent it was beyond my expectations i was very impressed by the professional team  for sure ill recommend this hotel to my friends and business partners next time i visit paris it will be on top of my listpathetic unhelpful and would never recommend to anyone  customer service was non existent and we were made to feel unwelcome and that any form of help was too much of an effort the rooms are patheticwe could hear snoring next door the shower next door was right behind the bed wall the heater sounded like a steam train and the floor would have been more comfortable than the bed to ask for any assistance from staff seemed like they had to cut off a leg for you too much effort for them to even look you in the eye or give you more than 4 words in a sentence to top off our experience we had a 330am phone call from reception that was meant for another room seriously we would never recommend this hotel to anyone or anything as you will probably have a better experienceeverything was good once i arrived the staff was perfect and everything was okay  the location and everything even the room that was so small but it is still good the worst thing happened to me at this hotel was on my check out i booked a share bus to the airport at4 am  by mistake my alarm on the phone didnt work and i over slept the guy who was working down stairs called me to awake me up in a very strange way he didnt even say hello or good morning he was shouting at me as if i am on of his children and this never happened to me since i started traveling i believe i made a mistake and i should have been there before 4 am but that was a mistake from me on his second call to me i told him the bus can go they dont need to wait sorry he kept showing bythe minerve hotel is perfectly located 5min walk to two metro stations and 10min to iledecite notre dame the room was very clean and the bed very comfortable we had a balcony which was very nice the room is quite small 11qm incl bathroom which is normal for paris we didnt expected the bathroom to only have a glassdoor as a couple that was ok but if you travel with friends it would better to have more privacywe had a great stay at this hotel room was very good cosy place super friendly receptionist would definitely go back great location as well only a few minutes from norte dame and with lots of restaurants near byconsidering this is a 3 star hotel in paris the rooms are the expected sizebut furnished well and a nice touch of painting the sky on our ceiling which made the room feel light and bigger  teacoffee facilities were neat and the bathroom had a shower in the bath and we used both again no complaints staff were friendly and spoke excellent english location suited us as we were there to meet friends and family just round the corner it was also better value than some of the local 3 star alternatives would stay again if in the area without a doubt,very new room very clean great bed and shower only the elevator was small as almost everywhere in paris would stay here certainly again great service also hotel has 4 parking spaces for 25 euro so bookearly. excellent hotel friently staff particularly mr victor good locationtwo blocks of seine clean hotel i would highly recommend it ideal for couples but also for family  very safe area  easy access to metro and busest.
"Niepce Paris Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton",my wife and i stayed here for 9 nights between december 28 and january 7  we had a wonderful time  the staff was extraordinary every interaction we had with them  was pleasant and they patiently helped me with my atrocious french even though they all spoke perfect english   nine nights is plenty of time to tire of a place and plenty of time for them to tire of you  but we never tired of the hotel niepce and the staff was just as charming the day we left as the day we arrived we walked and took buses everywhere because the metro was down and every night we would be thrilled to return to our little section of montparnasse which felt completely non touristy as compared to some other neighborhoods  thank you hotel niepce staff and thank you paris  we hope to return soonloved our stay here benoit tongi and sameera im sorry if i havent got her name right  went out of their way to help us out with everything suggestions on where to eat best way to travel handy tips for visiting the louvre and the palace of versailles they were warm and attentive coming back to the hotel after a long day of travel always felt like returning home thank you so much for making our trip excellent and leaving us with such wonderful memories  the location of the hotel is excellent too with montparnasse station walking distance away rooms are good nice breakfast spread highly recommend this hotelwe had a very stay in this beautiful hilton boutique hotel very nice interior design good service at anytime we also recommend the nice restaurant where chef cooks a great frenchjapanese fusion cuisine enjoyable placemake this your new hotel of choice for paris especially if you are a hilton honors member  excellent location for shopping food and next to a metro station pernety which gives you easy access to the whole parisand to normandyhighly recommend this hotel from the minute we arrived til the time we left the staff was so kind friendly and helpful super clean beds were very comfortable large bathroom area restaurant was excellent great vibe overallthis is such a great hotel the staff is amazing and so genuinely interested in helping its guests with any issues or questions the hotel is well appointed and very comfortable the location is great for exploring all parts of the city with a metro stop just steps away from the lobby my wife and i stayed here to celebrate her birthday and we couldnt be happier with the staff and the roomthis hotel was a great find the rooms are new and very clean the beds are so comfortable the staff is so helpful didnt speak any french but they were so quick to help i only wish i could remember their names to thank them for such a wonderful experience didnt have a chance to eat at the restaurant but did try their coffee and croissant i cant wait to go backwe had a very nice stay for a week  the hotel is beautifully appointed and newly renovated the room very comfortable though small typical of an older city  the staff from benoit hayku and bryce at the front desk to brian at the bar were exceptionally engaging  the food in the restaurant was excellent from the breakfast to dinners  rosalyn the manager inquired quite a few times about our stay and travels we have stayed at hiltons around the world and this was one of the nicest stays due to the staff    we look forward to a return visitjust the best and so many people there to thank good room good restaurant wonderful staff and super service  we want to thank   rozaine the director benoil our room manager brice the night manager and wally and tangi at the reception desk was samira big hug from us and tenzin and haybro might be badly spelled in the restaurant was xavier the manager kassim and sandrine for dinner they each played a part in our tooshort stay with them we will be backbeautiful modern and wonderful service quiet convenient location great restaurant asian inspired boutique hotel nearby restaurants and grocery store metro 2 blocks away uber couldnt find the hotel but staff got taxi to airport right awayjust checked into hotel niepce after arriving early to paris at 9am  tenzin was an exceptional host who worked her magic to allow us to check in early so we could rest and relax she gave us so much helpful information about the hotel and nearby attractions looking forward to my stay the next couple of dayssnuggled down a quiet side street this little gem of a hotel surprises you sat in the 14th arrondissement you are a short walk away from various shops bars cafes restaurants and the metro the rooms are wonderfully presented clean and cared for the staff are helpful and cater for those of us with little more than a rudimentary grasp of the french language my only complaint was breakfast i felt it was limited and the quality vs price wasnt what ive grown accustomed to in my many travelscurio collection hilton tucked away in 14th  arrondissement in paris great dining streets and carrefour city nearby tour montparnasse i is a helpful landmark to return to hotel if walking and walking to champ de mars and pantheon is each 2km away exceptional service and staff at hotel well designed throughout doesnt feel like a cookiecutter hilton great restaurant at hotel with japanese styled fusion dinner menu excellent breakfast unions on strike when we stayed so travelling around paris more difficult but didnt detract from hotel location 23km from centre highly recommend niepcenice boutique type hotel  the hotel is a great location close the train station  howeverdriving a vehicle here can be a bit of a challenge as you park at the train station 1015 min walk  5 min drive it costs 40 euros a night and if you have a larger american vehicle getting in and out of the garage is a nightmare  otherwise the staff and location are greatthe reception team at the niepce are terrific very helpful with receiving and securing a couple of packages for me they understand customer service and communication the whole team was made aware of my request and all shifts were engaged thank youwe spent 3 nights here in june and had the time of our lives great rooms great location close to subway and restaurants the rooms are very nicely appointed wonderful breakfast front desk staff were amazingly friendly and helpful well be backvery near gare montparnasse this area of paris has some great local cafs and fantastic views of the eiffel tower the niepce paris hotel is an amazing find in this neighborhood the hotel has apparently been newly renovated and the decor is fantastic but what is best is the service everyone made us feel incredibly welcome and valued especially as a hilton honors member the food service is excellent the rooms are funkycool and incredibly

hotel by an incredibly friendly and helpful staff our room was quirky beauriful devorated and very comfortable  after a short walk around the local area the next morning we were shown to the restaurant for breakfast breakfast was simple but under the circumstances very understandable staff were attentive when necessary it was a skeleton staff but their manner was efficient calm and friendly we really jope the management and owners appreciate their staff as ijn difficult time they were a shining lightwe were reasuured by them as it was a stressful time to be travellingi was in paris for a work trip and wanted to stay with the hilton brand hotels i found this one and so glad i chose it the hotel is very conveniently located  i walked everywhere but i also like to walk i walked to the arc de triumph moulin rouge and many other sites hotel is very classy and staff helpful breakfast was amazing too  gym was perfect for what i neededmy husband and i stayed in paris for one week in november for our 10 year wedding anniversary we stayed in two different rooms at the niepce paris hotel due to splitting our trip between paris and london we stayed in a suite and a deluxe room our experience at this hotel was fabulous the hotel is beautiful and the hospitality was great our concierge was excellent and he worked most days and nights we were at the hotel this hotel is located a few blocks from the perenty metro station it is an easy walk to close restaurants and grocery stores this hotel is located in a more residential area and we felt safe we would definitely stay at this hotel againi can not physically recommend niepce hotel enough best overseas stay i have had in all my travels the staff is amazing truly went above and beyond with assisting us they even help fresh my french linguistic skills,my wife and i stayed here for 9 nights between december 28 and january 7. We had a wonderful time  the staff was extraordinary every interaction we had with them  was pleasant and they patiently helped me with my atrocious french. The location of the hotel is excellent too with montparnasse station walking distance away rooms are good nice breakfast spread highly recommend this hotel.
Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse,we stayed at this hotel for 4 nights part of euro trip to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary easy check in and out with helpful staff our room executive room with double bed is spacious by paris standard with complimentary mini bar and high speed internet location wise is close to the gare montparnasse hence easy public transport nearby charming local residential area with local cafes dotted around a good and comfy stay overall  cheers crespo  sarahpicked novotel because we had recently had another good experience with the hotel chain and we like the standard they have not super luxury but good 4 star hotel room modern and good bathroom not a noisy room and only noise bothered us was the bathroom noise of guests above us with toilet usage in middle of night breakfast wa snot included for us but we used it one time and good but can get better for this price outside hotelthe room was too small and they didnt clean the room well when we left for the day even the towels werent changed the staff werent helpful at all when we tried to ask them for help for a taxi the location is great and the breakfast is good but i dont recommend this hotel if youre looking for a more friendly helpful environmenti was in this hotel and found the service poor  especially the manager dominique  i was mistreated  never came back i was devastated  it was my worst christmas  im sad to have stayed me ill never be backthis is our 1st trip to paris and i am glad that i chose this hotel which had great reviews  the location of this hotel is not bad  accessible to transportationbus stops and metro stops although public transportation is on strike at this moment which i believe is over a month now  either you walk or take the uber  distance to central paris is not bad  about 15 to 20 minutes by uber to go to eiffel tower  give some time to get to places    the food selection at the restaurant is good too  the breakfast buffet has a good selection of food to choose from    hotel rooms and bathrooms are very clean and you could hardly hear noise of your neighbor  staff are very nice and helpful  surrounding areas has plenty of restaurants to choose from  maybe about 3 blocks or athis hotel is currently under renovation which is well needed it looks tired although in a very good location central to main attractions of paris very friendly staff whom where helpful bedrooms clean and tidy although seemed to be very warm even with the heating off would recommend as a cheap base just really used for sleeping  im sure once the hotel has finished being renovated it will be of a much better standard  if your looking for somewhere basic and clean in a good location this is the hotel for you no frills classic 3 star we would saythe hotel had a good vibe about it with nice furnishings and it was clean i enjoyed the breakfast and the photo machine the hotel was in a good area of paris to walk to major attractions with its height it was easily recognizable in the citymy wife and i went with another couple for vacation  right off the bat our rooms werent ready on time so we left our luggage at the hotel and came back later  the checkin process feels a bit disorganized with the checkin desk being two high tops near the entrance    the other thing is that the hotel caters to families with kids and i wish we had known that before booking  we couldnt really have a relaxing drink at the bar since kids were running around shouting throughout the stay  if you are looking for a relaxing place to stay on your trip to paris look elsewherewe very much enjoyed our stay at novotel paris centre gare montparnasse all the staff were kind and attentive and the breakfast is a feast the hotel is about a 30minute walk to the eiffel tower and there are many restaurants cafes shops etc surrounding it the hotel is very clean and contemporary our only issue was that our tv wouldnt allow for english subtitles but since we watched very little tv while there we didnt complainhotel has great location super customer service great brkfst and late night coffee short walk to the pasteur metro and right next to gare montparnasse suggest to get a room in the front to avoid noise in the rear  highly recommend local restaurant caf templier a few steps away best kept secret in montparnassei loved the stay you get excellent value for your money at this hotel the room does not have a single unnecessary square centimeter and few frills but it was perfect for a good night sleep it was my second stay and if i need a place in paris ill stay there againwe recently stayed at the novotel for our stay in paris and visit to disneyland paris   the room was spacious enough but there was very little space to hang clothes we could not hang 2 adult and 2 childrens winter coats   the hotel is fairly central to lots of cafes bars shops and bakerys   the hotel is a good 20  30 min walk from several metros stops enabling you to travel around paris fairly easily it was tricky with cases and tired children we are seasoned travelers too   you can see the effiel tower from the end of the street and from the 8th floor of the hotel  it is also an easy 20  40 min walk to the tower from the hotel   if returning to paris we would not choose it again as it was not close enough to the metro stationsour stay was made comfortable enjoyable and happy by excellent staff djamel and camille were exceptionally helpful for us novice travellers in paris as were all others at the hotel halle quatre provided great breakfasts and excellent meals we enjoyed the very best gts made by hotel staff and a wonderful selection of french wines the room was clean well appointed and very comfortable we will stay again and are happy to provide the highest recommendation for novotel gare montparnassewe chose the novotel hotel for our 4 day trip in paris and everything was so great the accommodation was very clean and comfortable for our family of 4 it is so idealistically big enough the care of the hotel staff is also moving they helped us quickly with each of our requests in a very polite manner the hotel has a great location too from which we can see eiffel tower we really recommend this hotelgreat location great for exploring and walking around the centre of paris 30 minute walk to the eiffel toweryou can see from a distance one road away from the hotel 15 minute on the metro to arc de triomphe   we spent 2 nights at the novotel centre paris montparnasse in november 2019 contemporary and modern loungebar area with friendly front of house staff the rooms are clean spacious bath and shower also with a separate toiletwell situated close to the montparnasse train station this is comfotable hotel the rooms are clean and modern the staff is friendly and the breakfast abundant for paris standards the place is not overly expensive eitheri was invited by french friends who chose this hotel located near the train station i really appreciated the welcome the location of the hotel the comfort of my room the excellent breakfast the quality of the cleaning the fast wifi connection i will try to return with my wifegreat hotel located in a nice area of paris only a five minute walk to a metro station and a train station  modern reception nice employees rooms ok we missed some closets to put our clothes in but that is the only thing we missed in this hotel   we would recommend and stay here again6 of ilya stated here for a flying visit to paris you can walk to the eiffel tower from the hotel rooms were very clean and prices were good bathrooms fantastic and shower was absolutely amazing a full rain shower large plasma screen tv also the hotel is opposite the train station also we arrived late and even though the restaurant was just closing they served us we all had burgers and while a little rare they were gorgeous the staff were really friendly and welcoming we would definitely returnwell located close to the train station of montparnasse and to the metro stations this hotel is clean and comfortable the breakfast is great the staff is friendly for paris the price is acceptableit is my second stay in this hotel it has been upgraded is in very good shape and very well located unbeatable quality  price and service just one thing that could improve i booked an executive room which included minibar and nespresso where there was literally one bottle of water one cola and one orange juice for the whole stay so not even a chance of choosing two people the same drink and same think for the nespresso capsules i guess it makes sense from a waste point of view it is a courtesy not a drink buffet but i found it quite short staff were friendly and helpful all through the stay very efficient with check in and check out will certainly repeat when in paristhe only issue we had was finding the reception area  looked more like going into a cafe when we entered and reception could be on another floor  it was on the ground floor but behind us as we entered other than that the stay was goodwe chose this hotel for its accommodation for a family of four with two young daughters of 12 and 14 the room given was spotlessly clean with the sofa turned into two comfy single beds with nice pillows and matress also for its location in neckerfalguire residential neighbourhoods where districts 6 14 and 15 meets each other lots of restaurantscafsboulangeriespattiseriesbrasseries nearby also many small supermarkets pharmacies and services rentacar etc the hotel is 7 mins walk from two metro stations pasteur green 6 and 12 lines and gat light blue line 13 it also has ebikes and electric scooters parkings in front of the main entrance and in many of the surrounding corners theyre a fantastic way of transport last but not least the hotel is justas a family we had a great time at this hotel it was clean comfortable close enough to go anywhere in paris with a lots of transport close by  the food was very good and the staff where very professional and very kind especially the gentleman called djamel he was very professional and very helpful  always smiling and very kind he did all his best to make our stay a good experience thank you dear djamel you are a star keep the good work will defently come backwell located close to the train station of

Novotel Paris Les Halles,location is perfect rooms are excellent but tv does not function and this was apparently true for many rooms so i could not even move to another room breakfast was super small but a manager helped me out upon checking out i asked for the receipt to be send by email and after 5 days i still did not receive it i tried to call but i am put through to a reception that does not respond and i tried to email but no reply there is a good potential for this hotel to become very good but staff needs to be more coordinatedits located in les halles walking distance from the best the city of paris can offer the louvre and la gare dorsay rue saint honore and place vendome restaurants from les marees to la rive gauche a boulangerie producing the best bread i ever tasted relaxing

pantheon and much more front desk was extremely courteous and service was great definitely will stay here againlovely staff absolute excellent locations with the metro at your doorstep given a free upgrade to exec suite which was fab large spacious bathroom felt clean and sophisticated decor   only downsides were the limited breakfast menu and cleaning services both due to covid 19 precautions which was understandablegood hotel in the right district uif i am is paris i am staying in this hotel staff is very friendly  for older people the douche cabine is a bit dangerous while  you can easlily fall down no support to keep you standing if the floor is wet en some soap has fallen on the floorexcellent service by the staff of the hotel very good breakfast buffet with kind service from

roomvery good bedcleanquiet very good breakfasthelpful staff excellent locationvery close to rue de rivoli with louvre and notre damme close literally on top of the metro station with direct connections to probably all main attractions the area is full of a great variety if restaurants etc i definitely recommend it and certainly we will stay there again at our next visit to parisi was shocked and found it disgusting that on two mornings i saw that different waiters were cleaning the tables with the same cleaning cloth that they used to wipe the seats of the chairs it was gratifying that everyone had their own bamboo tongs to use at the buffet but there were also used or badly cleaned tongs  i wonder what else happens in the room to prepare clean cook always when staff feels unattendedi asked for a quiet room since i have a problem sleeping first night out of three our room was very noice sound came from some kind of a machine on roof but mr benjamin guest relation manager helped us in an outstanding way he did not only helped us with a new room a very quiet one he was also very empathetic and concerned that we did have a nice day in paris even if i did not get a good night sleep every day of our stay he checked in on us me and my two small children and asked us if everything was well benjamin was so lovely and helpful and that changed my mood from a bad one to a great one we had a wonderful stay   problems do occur occasionally when travelling and as a guest the service is the thing that bring that feeling of safety and easiness grandvery welcoming at reception nice room condition for transportation restaurants and louvre it is perfect i saw that they are cleaning regularly the common use area such as elevator it make us more comfortable so we will stay againour stay was perfect  the hotel is lovely the room was spacious for our family of 4 and seemed newly renovated  the location is easy for sight seeing and from transport from cdg  the shower and bath products were fab  what really topped it off was the exceptional concierge pierreyves who welcomed us and went above and beyond to give us ideas and advice  he chose a memorable restaurant in montmartre for our last night and helped us navigate the city bikes for a memorable day biking the sights and patiently gave us lots of other input as well  he is a gemreally nice people at the reception desk good location very central from chatelet we can go everywhere in paris intramuros everything was clean the hotel looks chic and modern and the breakfast was good i would definitely come backthe check in was quick and with all info we needed  the location is great highly reccomended    rooms are spaceous and super clean wifi is good   the hotel staff is friendly and very helpful   i will definietly stay there again   thanksgreat moment at this hotel with an amazing teatime  the place is magical and you feel privileged by the quality of the service   service was really nice and the dessert unbelievable   such a good time this hotel is excellent my family feel at home here the receptionist are very friendly and helpful the room is clean and comfy the surrounding is perfect for tourists as it is in the center of paris very close to metro station french people are friendly especially the women beutifull thanks harlyn sianturi baligeokay lets start with the positives this hotel is in a very good location a few steps away from les halles metro station it has a nespresso machine in the bedroom and you can request additional pods from reception   i was travelling with my husband and our 15 year old daughter we booked a room with two queen beds thinking there would be additional space there wasnt the room was very cramped and there was no usable mirror near a plug  to allow you to style your hair there was a hairdryer in the very cramped bathroom this hairdryer like all hotels wasnt fit to style my hair and there was nowhere to plug straighteners in etc the curtains in the room were covered in holes which allowed the sunlight to shine through in the morning not what i would expect of a 4 stari visited the property after three years since last stay visited 9th  12th of september  the hotel is very well located next to les halles station with perfect metro connection and next to b line from airport  we ordered executive king room we got room 208 it seems rooms 202 204 206 all have openable windows into the dining hall and not to the outside this might be acceptable if air conditioning ac was working it was not  it was blowing in air but warm air only  as the room was quite warm weaking up sweating we talked to the front desk three times during different shifts on all occations they were goin to look at it or send somone  in none of the occasion we received any feedback   it became clear to me that the hotel was going to ignore this problem,location is perfect rooms are excellent but tv does not function and this was apparently true for many rooms so i could not even move to another room breakfast was super small but a manager helped me out upon checking out. there is a good potential for this hotel to become very good but staff needs to be more coordinated its located in les halles walking distance from the best the city of paris can offer the louvre and la gare dorsay rue saint honore.

shopping queen this is not the area to stay very small rooms but nicely decorated and clean friendly staff all over the hotelhotel located in a busy location but quiet good for city trips per metro or walkink verry friendly staff the house is modern but has charm clean room and a good breakfast we got a good suggestion for lunchclean convenient and next to the gare de lyon the staff were friendly and helpful and we enjoyed our stay easy walk to the notre dame dining and a small supermarket right down the street we would stay here againi have already been to the hotel palym three times and have always been very satisfied the location directly at the gare de lyon is very practical and the metro in the train station offers a good connection to the center of paris the hotel is not particularly large and therefore somehow personal the single rooms are not large but have everything you needaccidental tgv to paris from avignon requiring a quick search for overnight accommodation near the train station  the hotel is literally across the street from the station and surrounded by restaurants featuring different cuisine  friendly staff and importantly they provide spare pillows  got a good rate for accommodation that equalled the higher end hotel i stayed at during vin paris 2020 future stops in paris for meetings will see me returnmy first reason for the choice is the very good location near railway station but i found a room comfortable and clean and cleverly furnished lightening well thought  a very pleasant night of rest i definitely recommend itwe really didnt expect such a wonderful and clean hotel just 4 minutes from the train station  staff was nice and helpful rooms were quiet and the breakfast was good  highly recommend for overnight stayclean great service comfortable bed and right at gare lyon  they take extra care to make sure everyone is safe and comfortable during covid  breakfast is delivered to our room  the front desk people are the bestnice hotel just out of the real center of paris the hotel is very close top gare de lyon which makes it also very close to the paris islands bastille louvre les halles etc although near the road and the railway station the rooms are isolated so you wont hear traffic and other noises rooms are small but comfortable with everything you need breakfeast was very sufficient to start your dayi spend a lot of time in paris for work and have stayed at a lot of hotels this is among the best that i have used it is consistently excellent  the rooms are a good size for paris with comfortable beds and practical shower rooms the front desk staff are always helpful polite and responsive and the staff that clean the rooms are very good at what they do  the breakfast is excellent too lovely bread good coffee scrambled egg bacon croissants and more for me the only thing are that are missing is some kind of fruit salad although there is fresh fruit available and ketchup but i really do feel ashamed to type that  the location is good with the gare de lyon on your doorstep and despite me usually arriving at montparnasse there is a very handy bus that goesbecause it is so near the gate dr lyon and because we were traveling by train we stayed here  this is not a luxury hotel  under renovation for quite some time it is coming along  the lobby floor is incomplete but not unpleasant the staff was very courteous and helpful rooms are small but very clean an easy walk to the bastille and across the street from the train station  at the opposite end of the street we discovered le duc de richelieu it is a charming restaurant with personal  friendly service nice wine and good food loved iti chose this hotel due to its proximity to the gare de lyon i am moving to montpellier and hoped to find regular hotel in paris near to the train there are plusses but nothing makes up for the owner and staff minuses the room a single was small even by paris standards with no luggage stand the suitcase lived on the floor and had to be constantly kicked aside the shower was so small that you shouldnt take this room is you are at all hefty i am 53106 when i twice dropped the soap i seriously hit my head on the sharp door handle on the way up tip step outside the shower retrieve the soap and step back in lots of noise through the thin walls even with their normal activity bring earplugs for that my other gripe was the way they handled the lobby renovationi chose this hotel because i had to take an early morning train  the location is very convenient  the rooms are comfortable well equipped and brand new  the staff is very pleasant  i highly recommend ithotel is clean and neat exactly what we are looking for its center location is wonderful close to gare de lyon and walking distance to some paris attraction if you like to walk around as to explore paris its location is really good despite so close to the downtown and busy area it is not noisy at all in the roomgreat location facing the gare de lyon but the street was quiet the room was very clean and that was reassuring considering the circumstances breakfast was great  free for kids staff was nice and friendly highly recommendedi have been in this hotel before and will go there again whenever spending time in paris the hotel is very well situated  near gare de lyon and metro  and is good value for money the rooms are nice and the staff is very friendlywe stayed here for a weekend trip to paris was a nice clean comfortable hotel we were surprised by the for paris spacious room with a king size bed the toilet on the other hand was a bit small my knees knocked against the door the bathroom was nice with a big shower breakfast was served in the room due to covid was a decent breakfast location was excellent if you need to use public transport across from gare de lyon in a side street super for catching the metro  only negatives the airconditioning didnt work the 2nd night but it wasnt too bad and we woke up a few times due to people out on the street shouting in the middle of the night we had a room on the street side but the hotel cant do much about that  all in all we enjoyed our stay and werethe hotel rooms were new clean comfortable bed was comfortabl the hotel was at  great location very close to the gare de lyon  good for a quick overnight stay  staff was efficient and friendly would stay againwe stopped at the palym hotel with my daughter and it was really disappointing of all our 20 years old travel stories this was the worst hotel and most terrible staff that is why i am writing this review this is the first time i experienced so much bad customer service the staff was really unfriendly and behaved creepily the hotel is really small and the rooms even smaller and really cold so after checking out we left a couple of bags in the hotels luggage compartment when we returned to the hotel to pick up the bags the man at the reception shouted at us to disappear immediately because of the covid i went to the bathroom for about 5 mins fillowed by my daughter went to the bathroom for the same time i told the man from the staff that when my daughter comes out ofsmall but charming room clean and comfortable practical and clean bathroom nice shower very quiet hotel despite the proximity of the train station very convenient location very easy to find super teams night team included,value for money welcoming and helpful after a long journey very handy for early morning tgv friendly restaurants and bars nearby for evening meal felt safe with regard to covid precautions will use again for this journey.very nice accomodation near gare du lyon very clean comfortable the bed was very big and comfy the shower was amazing the only thing i would change is the toilet is quite small there is no room for legs especially for tall persons will sure return.
Passy Eiffel Hotel,the hotel is placed on a very beautiful street with a view of the eiffel tower the rooms are pleasant the reception works 247 which is crucial for us since we are walking till late

only a 10min walk the staff are so nice and the breakfast is greatthe locations is very good close to the metro many shops along the street and nice restaurants clean rooms and newly furbished bathrooms windows are soundproof staff is nice and friendly only minus would be that breakfast is served at the table and every morning same choice but you can order more so it is big enough my room

reservation if you are looking to stay in the 16th you cant beat this location easy walking distance to the tower and the seine for sure and not far to bois de boulogne the other direction also a very short walk to the metro for everything else rue de passy itself is lovely especially at night as it has overhead lights all the way along with many restaurants on close proximity the room i had was spacious enough clean and comfortable and with a reasonably priced minibar the courtyard view meant it was very quiet nice modern bathroom the breakfast is very nice served in a cute room off the main

care and courtesy by  the staff our luggage was taken to our room which was well appointed and the bed was most comfortable the hotel has a friendly atmosphere and rather elegant in its presentation and we would definitely recommend it and look forward to returning soonthe 4 of us 2 retired couples from the sonoma county ca wine country ended up at this hotel after 2 covid related rebookings with another hotel that sent our booking to the hotel passy eiffel as a result of not reopening as planned   got all that  the change of booking proved to be a great one at that as our original hotel was a 2 and the hotel passy eiffel is a 3  the hotel is wellsituated with a view of the eiffel tower  we landed in paris on july 24 bastille day and enjoyed the best fireworks show ever from our window  truth be known there was a little leaning out of  the window involved  there is a great pastry shop a few doors down the source for  morning croissants and coffee which we would bring back to the hotel and enjoy in a small and verywe had a room for 3 it was very roomy to be a paris room the bathroom as well all clean and nice from our french balcony we could see the eiffel tour the front desk was helpful breakfast was boring french only baguette and croissant with coffee and juice the breakfast staff did not speak any english  the hotel is in a nice neighborhood with some restaurants close by and a lot of shops closest metro station passy was closed during our stay but it is not a long walk to trocaderothe hotel was great and the stuff was extremely pleasant and took very good care of us the location is just extraordinary to get to know the eiffel tower and the surroundings i 100 would recommend it it was a bargain for that pricea good location close to eiffel tower passy is a good neighbor to hang out in metro close by a cozy and warm hotel with nice decor and helpful staff good breakfast room and smoking area in back courtyardeveryone at this hotel was extremely friendly and

very friendly staff who spoke good english and were very accommodating the room was very nice and quiet but could have been a bit cleaner the hotel was also in a really convenient location with a

Pley Hotel,stayed here a couple of times for work very nice people at reception nice roof top bar and great location great cafe across the road nice pubs and other restaurants nearby modern rooms and quiet at night i highly recommendrecently stayed in paris for 5 nights  after the first day my husband and i expressed some concerns with the management  they handled it well and professionally we will be staying at pley hotel in the future  its in a great location to the champslyses and the george v metro stopnice rooms but we mentioned a broken coffe machine several times and it was never replaced there were also other minor broken equipment in the rooms at the fifth floor we had a room next to the roof top terrace and it was loud music until 11 pm it was also fully booked every night so we were not able to enjoy it ourselfreally enjoyed the room and the hotels theme the room was clean cozy comfortable bed could be better if they would have used one big mattress instead of 2 single ones side by side cose to various attractions great places to eat nearby and good transport linksrecently stayed in paris for 5 nights  after the first day my husband and i expressed some concerns with the management  they handled it well and professionally we will be staying at pley hotel in the future  its in a great location to the champslyses and the george v metro stoprooms were lovely bathrooms a little dated great amenities with the facility but the best part was the staff the best most courteous and caring staff we have ever met we had a mishap where our 2 year had to be taken to the emergency via ambulance the staff took brilliant care of us translated for us got the ambulance and doctors on the phone and consoled us at the same time they were accommodating to a level i didnt

beautifully decorated and very comfortable the staff were friendly and attentive the location was convenient to all hot spots whether on foot or by metro highly recommend this will go back each visit nowthis is a modern htel in  grt location close to the arc de triomphe and champs elyses sadly the service was shocking first we had arranged a taxi with the htel to go to the theatre we came to wait at reception and after waiting a while we enquired with the front desk about where our taxi was and they checked their system and said the taxi had been cancelled as a result we were late there was no sort of apology  in the morning when we went to enquire about printing our covid certificates halfway into the conversation th phone rang and the lady picked it up without saying excuse me or apologising and continued talking on the phone without acknowledging it after about ten minutes we gave up and went to breakfast pretty shocked  the room itself was fine clean andhotel is good located in nice area friendly reception staff however bathroom was not very clean there i found a several long black hairs which are not mine   also 2 broken tails on the side of bathit was a 4star hotel the room is smaller in person than in the picture when i booked it i expected better and on our building there are 2 small elevator with only 2 person can fit they are very slow to operate and if you are claustrophobic you will have a panic attack inside their elevator we stayed 6 nights in this hotel it did not met our expectation i will do better research on our next hotelgood enough if you need somewhere cosy the hotel staff help you feel welcomed although i never quite saw the roof top garden or make use of other amenities at the hotel be warned your big luggage bag might not fit inside the lift also thin walls might mean youre unable to sleep best feature is the lobby area the gym could definitely be much more bigger but it does the job i followed pley hotel on instagram for months before arrival and also checked them out on tripadvisor before booking it all looked very exclusive and that made sense as it is a 4 star hotel   but when we arrived it felt more like if you had swiped a pretty person on tinder that didnt look like the photo when meeting them in real life   it felt more like a 3 star   loud cheap materials moldy shower was some of the issues we were dissapointed about   we first got assigned a room on 3rd floor windows facing the street with closed windows we were disturbed with the trafic noise some singing concert across the street and people chattering on the street   we then got moved to a new room on 6th floor facing away from the street smaller room with a tiny bathroom with moldthe breakfast is really nice we especially love they have plenty juice options the comfortness of the hotel is good the bathtub and the floor mat is not clean the location is in a safe area the pillows are too smallquiet clean updated lots nearby space in the room for 1 adult and 1 teen was good clean hotel and room staff was so helpful and welcoming walk to notre dame 1 hr walk to eiffel tower 35 mins right bank safe locationgreat personnel in reception breakfast and cleaning the cleaning was great if we had a resting day at the hotel and we left the hotel in the afternoon to eat they had cleaned it when we came back good breakfast with most things needed omelette was very nice nice rooftop bar great location near arc de triumph and subway walk to ternes area for nice brasseries restaurants with real french food dont eat near arc de triumph can also recommend a bar near trocadero called frog xiv which brew their own fantastic beer the area is also a very nice areawe enjoyed the hotel very much the room is comfortably furnished well situated clean airy well heated modernly staged and the staff are very friendly we will definitely visit again there is a radio to our use in the room which can be used as a speaker and that is verz cooljust loved this hotel spacious rooms newly renovated in a cool style fantastic service minded staff good brekfast fairly calm area but close to everything and the little gem a roof top bar love itthis boutique hotel is very charming in retro vintage design staff are super friendly and speak english rooms are decent size with large opening windows to the city and have a wonderful rooftop bar that overlooks the city and even the eiffel tower location is great and within walking proximity to all locations breakfast is fantastic and honestly the price i paid for this gem was absolutely a steal would definitely stay againi traveled with my  toddler and had not issue at all reservation was swift checkin was smooth  friendly the room was big well designed clean great value for money and location could not be better  my new fav spot in parisabsolutely stunning hotel comfortable clean and colourful love the beautiful decor we spent a weekend here and wanted to stay longer lorraine was such a joy at reception and had our room upgraded to the superior suite with a balcony overlooking the eiffel towerperfection the rooftop is so cute and cosy staff are friendly and the breakfast was delicious the location is just a 10 min walk from arc de triomphe good transport links 30min walk to eiffel tower area by the hotel was nice and quite defintely will return for a longer stayi absolutely loved the aesthetics of this hotel its stunning unfortunately our room had a terrible smell that didnt go away the whole week and all the staff did was hand us a can of scent spray our room key didnt work four days in a row and when i suggested the fifth day they fix it before i went upstairs knowing i would need to come down again they had an attitude that didnt shift towards me the rest of our staymy boyfriend and i had an excellente stay at the pley hotel staff was super nice we even got a free upgrade into a superior room the interior decoration was absolutly beautiful and a mixture of modern and vintage the breakfast buffet was also very big and tasty loved the rooftop bar as well all in all a wonderful stay in parisstayed here on a recent trip to paris the location is great and the breakfast is perfect  my main issue was with the bed it was two singles pushed together and very uncomfortable mattress my main concern was the very strong horrible smell in the room it was actually overwhelming when you entered the room and upon talking to other guests it was other rooms than ours also overall its a budget hotel with a great location its handy if you wont be in the room all the time but its not a comfortable lounging roomonline the pley had a really new trendy vibe but upon arrival left a bit to be desired the room was not super well designed for a hotel that used a work and pley option as part of their marketing  the desk in the room doubled as a nightstand with a stool as a chair and the wifi was shotty there was a coworking  restaurant space on the lobby floor but for me me could have used a bit more designation  i didnt use it the rooms also did not have an additional security lock which as a woman is not ideal also re security  the elevators do not require keys to go up so in theory someone could just walk in and go up the bathroomsthe tub was high and as a shorter person you have to really mindfully step out of the tub the glass screen had little mobility which meantmy family and i thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel while in paris it was conveniently located near champs delyse restaurants shops and bakeries the hotel desk staff were friendly and helpful the breakfast buffet offered the most delicious croissants and coffee the lobby was also clean and modern thank you so much for the room upgrade upon our return from the cte dazur will definitely return merci beaucoup,stayed here a couple of times for work very nice people at reception nice roof top bar and great location great cafe across the road nice pubs and other restaurants nearby modern rooms and quiet at night i highly recommendrecently stayed in paris for 5 nights  after the first day my husband and i expressed some concerns with the management  they handled it well and professionally we will be staying at pley hotel in the future.
Pullman Paris Eiffel Tower Hotel,the location of the hotel is perfect 1 block away from the eiffel tower we stayed at the hotel because we booked a room with a balcony view of the hotel the view was amazing literally right next to it   overall the hotel was great hotel was clean and front desk personnel were very helpful and welcoming   on our last day we decided to get breakfast at the hotel since we were leaving on a an international flight the breakfast was amazing and well stocked but was kind of pricey 30 euros for each adult1 my rooms were not ready upon my arrival  i had ordered two connecting rooms for me and my twin daughters on my arrival at 1 pm which was announced only one room was ready i had to take a business call while asking my daughters to keep silent for 3 hours 2 i had to call reception multiple times to ask when the second room was finally going to be ready 3 no parking was available hotel description stating otherwise i had to assertively ask reception to find a solution to park my car no replacement solution offered proactively 4 i am a gold member and when i complained again  very angrily at my checkout i was offered a 150 euros discount off my 1000 euro bill  whereas i should have been offered at least one of the two rooms for the full stay i will noteven the view of eiffel tower cannot be complained but the staff is the worst ad ive ever experienced  on the day i arrived my husband cannot find a place to park even i ask the security at the door but he has no idea to help my husband has to park very far in the main street and work to the hotel with a big suitcase then  i came first at the reception with my baby all the receptionist just looked at me like i am lost without any welcome until the security inside of the hotel not the useless security outdoor help me with my baby stroller  finally i arrived in front of one man receptionist he told me that not this way because maybe i come here just for looking like a homeless until i said that i have a booking he looked at me with a weird face  ask me rudelyour travel company placed us at the pullman and we were delighted  it is a modern luxurious hotel and easy to like but dont take our word while we were there the french olympic basketball team stayed at the hotel and we have heard the many of the tennis players from the french open were guests as well the room are quiet and up to date with electric plugs that conform to any device you  might have  breakfast was wonderful with a good selection and madetoorder eggs the only down side we encountered was a very late cleaning of our room after a long day sightseeing but the staff sent a cleaning crew to the room very quickly be sure to visit the 10th floor restaurantbar on the hour after dark as the tower will have a surprise for you on the houri have enjoyed my stay at the hotel and my room breakfast was great also the proaction in regards of covid19 was very good staff so polite  i would like to thank the team of the hotel all i have enjoyed my visitwe stayed at pullman for our first wedding anniversary antonio at the reception was brilliant he upgraded us to a room with eiffel tower view no balcony but who stays in the room in paris anyway our stay was absolutely brilliant the breakfast was very good too they also gave us a food package to go on our checkout at 4 am the staff was super friendly and very helpful we will definitely come back and also recommend to our friendsthe view is awesome at first you  think its going to be a partial view  but from our room it was perfect  there was a party on the street every night it was mthnot even the weekend  i was supposed to have a king size bed went down to complain and was told to just  push them together the deadbolt didnt work tried to have a drink in the outdoor restaurant and was told we needed a reservation there was nobody there he let us sit but said we would have to move if people with reservations came in nobody came to serve usthe manager came over and said we could sit but if someone with reservations came in wed have to move we left how do you not know how many tables and reservations you have what a jerk the breakfast people were very nicepros great location nice hotel quick check in and out amazing view of the eiffel tower from our room very comfortable bed last but not least the food was amazing  cons huge carpet stain near bed no bathrobesquick check in room small as booked upgrade to a higher category for diamond status not included good hotel location breakfast buffet sufficient nice top floor restaurant unfortunately we were unable to get a table on saturday night despite being flexible in terms of the available time its hard the hotel did not react in any way on the birthday even a greeting card was not delivered i have never experienced such an approach beforerecently my husband and i took a trip to paris france unfortunately we booked the pullman hotel near the eiffel tower and had a terrible experience   during our first hour in our room someone opened our door without knocking they ended up leaving right away and i could not get a good look at them due to me trying to get my dogs away from the door when addressing it with the front desk they told me i should have put a sign on the front door saying do not distribute it turns out that housekeeping opened our door in my opinion no one should walk into your room without knocking i do not care if it house keeper or room service they should always knock but needless to say they were unbothered that housekeeping just walked into our room and did not even apologizethe staff its wonderful and the manager patrick complements your stay  highly recommended we love the hotel  the views from the rooftop restaurant nice breakfast inside the hotel  beautiful and we definitely going back in decembervery nice hotel everything was perfect  location rooms breakfast and service however room had some issues the air conditioning didnt work for a while other than that definitely met my expectations would stay again in the future and recommend it to othersvia hotelscom i booked a deluxe room 1 king bed balcony view eiffel tower view at the pullman paris which is indeed located very close to the eiffel tower   the reception area is not too exciting but check in was fairly quick and efficient   the room itself was a bit on the small side but otherwise pretty nice with a decent bathroom no tub but only shower though of course the main selling point of the room is the balcony which features a view of the eiffel tower you cant see the view from inside the room itself unfortunately   the balcony is a bit narrow but it does have chairs that allow you to sit and enjoy the spectacular view of the eiffel tower at night it is almost more impressive when it all lights up and sparkles once an hour the rest of thewe had been invited by clients who live in paris we had asked to be close to the eiffel tower or at least to have a view of this tower upon our arrival we had been very well received the room was ready for noon we had a very nice view of the eiffel tower excellent bedding nice bathroom excellent breakfast and all the staff had been very goodim writing this review as i lie awake at ten oclock at night listening to construction noise down on the street that has been so loud i cant get to sleep im in what id call a twin bed even though my husband prepaid handsomely for a king bed room when we told one of the women at the desk this afternoon we thought maybe wed been given the wrong room she said no that was a king and guests simply push the two beds together to make a king bed push the two beds together have you ever heard of that me eitherbest hotel we ever been there you can fell like you are a part of paris all desired comfort with an awesome view from the balcony since the checkin to checkout so the staff creat the most pleasant atmospheregorgeous hotel  security close to entrance felt very safe

security and front desk  fabulous  close to the train and many restaurants and shops rooms are spacious and modern  nice good bed comfort noise insulation can be improved noises from room above and outside difficult in q big city i know bathroom toilet in bathroom not seperate a rainshower very low water pressure breakfast standard for this kind of hotel nothing special though i would eat breakfast outside of the hotel cheaper and better service of staff  friendly and kind location close to tour eiffel only one subway line 6 and rer line nearby very expensive so price quality is just average one could say you pay for the location but most paris hotels are close to a famous monumentmuseumi did love the way of communication straight to the point actually their office was very fast i also felt pullman paris eiffel tower hotel were honest and treated us well i would definitely recommend pullman paris eiffel tower hotel to otherspros great location nice hotel quick check in and out

walls are paperthin i literally hear everything from the hallway to the rooms next to me and above the view is nice from my room thats about it very disappointedive just returned from a fabulous long

room thats about it very disappointedthe location is superb with good views of the eiffel tower close to bars and restaurants and a short walk to the river seine and trocadero a very good and extensive breakfast buffet to suit all tastes  rooms are functional and sufficiently spacious too  great staff and strict to enforce covid protocols which i applaudhow often do you get to paris so why not splurge a little and get a fantastic view and be just a block away from the tower the hotel is very nice and updated they have a restaurant that has seating with a tower view the staff was helpful and friendly there are plenty of outdoor cafes within walking distance for food or drinks walking distance to gift shops drug store and grocery store make sure to reserve a tower view room if you want the view my only minor complaint is the balcony furniture is lousy and outdatednice hotel great location  staff very professional  check in and out was very easy  spent one night would book again  hotel was very clean  restaurant was beyond expectations with a very nice breakfast buffetgorgeous hotel  security close to entrance felt very safe  ask for a view of the eiffel tower  facing rooms

offered proactively 4 i am a gold member and when i complained again  very angrily at my checkout i was offered a 150 euros discount off my 1000 euro bill. the only down side we encountered was a very late cleaning of our room after a long day sightseeing but the staff sent a cleaning crew to the room very quickly. be sure to visit the 10th floor restaurantbar on the hour after dark as the tower will have a surprise for you.
Residence Charles Floquet,well what can i say if you are looking for a fabulous view and to be close to the eiffel tower these apartments tick all the right boxes easy to find and there was offstreet parking but we decided to play it safe for security and park a 10minute walk to our prebooked parking lot when we arrived we had trouble getting in  you have to push the door hard and enter through the hallway to the left where you will be greeted by a polite receptionist he upgraded our room on arrival which was a nice surprise to a 3 bedroom instead of 2  the apartment was exceptionally clean and big we had no complaints whatsoever and it was more than adequate for one night to enjoy a day trip overall our stay was enjoyable and we would certainly look to stay here again in futurecomplete apt with home furniture suc as washing machine electric stove cutlery and toiletries eifel view from living room balcony make this apt tremendous will certainly go back to stay here again somedayabsolutely loved the apartment lots of space well laid out with all amenities and to top it all off the views of the eiffel tower are stunning there are a large number of grocery stores restaurants etc within walking distance so its very convenient the 3 bedroom has a separate living and dining area along with a completely fitted out kitchen overall a fantastic stay and very helpful people as well highly recommendedour apartment was upgraded on arrival apartment was clean spacious plus had amazing views of the eiffel tower staff were very welcoming and friendly i would definitely recommend this accomodation for those travelling to parisupgraded upon our arrival the location of this residence was awesome  away from the hassle and bustle of the busy streets yet close enough to get to major landmarks  with loads of restaurants and general stores nearby we even did some local food shopping and the locals made us feel very welcome  would definitely recommend this residence to others  and the views of the eiffel towerbreathtakingit has the best view and so convenient with stores and restaurant i will definitely be back all of us love the place not only because of the view but the convenience of the place it has a functioning washer and dryer which we were able to use i cant find anything bad to say about the apartment it will be my go to place i have a few people asking me about the placeclean large and comfortable  lovely view and surprisingly peaceful neighborhood  great set up for families  this worked out really well for us and we were traveling with our two boys 4 and 7 and my mother 3 adults 2 kids  highly recommendthis is one of those top secret paris jewels i even doubted in sharing because it was my secret but i will be fair and share it this is a top apartment beautiful in architecture spacious huge windows balcony looking at the eiffel tower it is 1min away from the entrance comfy beds best view the manager javier was absolutely the cherry on top he was kind and made us feel welcome immediately  one night we left our keys in the apartment very late in the night and he came to our help with a smile we felt so embarrassed but he made us feel great   the best of the best and this is my third time in pariswish i could give zero stars the hotel successfully preauthorized my credit card on 10919 over a month later on 112819 i received an email stating my reservation was canceled due to invalid credit card i contacted my bank and they said there were no new transactions declines or security alerts on my account from the hotel i called the hotel and was told it was a bookingcom issue i spoke to a bookingcom supervisor and he told me bookingcom does not have access to my credit card so they couldnt possibly decline my card i called the hotel again and spoke to a manager who was rude he wouldnt let me speak and insisted it was bookingcoms fault he denied that i had a previous preauthorization and wouldnt listen to a word i said he never even looked up myour family trip to paris was wonderful we stayed in the beautiful and spacious superior 3 bedroom apartment with 25 bathrooms it was clean and efficient with an awesome view of the sparkling eiffel tower excellent choicethis spot was prime location for where we wanted to be in paris for the price it was well worth it being that this isnt a hotel you do have to keep in mind theres no housekeeping and certain amenities are limited other than whats provided in the apartment  i would say things were a little outdated so i was underwhelmed staying in the apartment suite aside from  just sleeping   however stepping outside the door and having access to the eiffel tower as well as being within walking distance to parks shops and restaurants made up for it   i probably wouldnt stay here again but i would still recommend itmy family and myself stayed at the residence charles floquet for 4 days and its been an absolute bliss from the apartment super well appointed everything you need is there the lovely decoration and the space by itself which is very rare in paristhe apartment was huged  and the view yes the magnificent view on eiffel tower is just stunning and the service is just amaizing staff was so helpful and carrying that it added magic to our stay we did not want to leave that place  we really hope to come back very soon and stay longerwe stayed at this place for five nights over the christmas holidays the apartment we had on the second floor was a bit old but it was rather spacious than most in europe our kids enjoyed the eiffel tower light shows from our room the kitchenware in our apartment was rather too old and needed replacement there is a grocery store a few blocks from the apartment we enjoyed our stay but unfortunately we are not too keen to go back soonexceptional service from xavier with a once in a lifetime view from the 6th floor lots of communication from the time we booked xavier kindly organised champagne and chocolates at my request to surprise my daughter for her 18th every cent was worth it to wake up to that amazing view every day we booked a two bedroom for 6 of us and had no complaints xavier went above and beyond to help us when we needed to rebook tickets out due to the public transport strike which was a huge relief as we would have been stranded sincere thanks to xavier and staff for the great service we had before and during our staycheck in was a breeze and we were allowed to store our luggages before check in time the room is clean spacious and perfect for a family of 4  the only weird thing is that the toilet is separate from the bathroom and it is across the living room   the eiffel tower is 80 steps from our building which was great if you want to go back at see the tower in the evening  the cafes and restaurants are nearbywe tried to stay here last year but covid canceled it  location and views are perfect  several cafes 5 minutes walking away  very clean easy check in and we were upgraded on check in  kids didnt want to leave and neither did we  the only drawback was that we were on the other side of the town from everything else  so we had to metro or uber itfirst and foremost the privileged location of the building right in the centre of paris gives the extra advantage of easy accessibility to all the major city sights in addition to this the hotel apartments are spacious clean elegantly decorated well equipped and with a great view of the eiffel tower last but not least the director of the hotel who is also in charge of the bookings was extremely helpful and responded to our request for a change of our accomodation with efficiency and diligence all in all staying at this hotel truly resembles living in a residence rather than just another holiday accommodation my family and i were really thrilled to be so lucky as to find such a beautiful place to stay on our first trip to parisyou must stay here if youre in paris the residence is palatial  from the moment we arrived to the second we departed we loved every moment  first of all request a room with a tour eiffel view our 5th floor apartment had a mindblowing view which we enjoyed all day long and in the evening when the tour lights come on and subsequently twinkle 5 minutes on every hour from sunset to 1 am the apartments are huge 1500 sqft by french or american standards we felt like millionaires two ensuite bedrooms with large windows which open wide for fresh air and a third 12 bath  we really appreciated the washerdryer and used it frequently also the apartment comes with 3 coffee makers including a nespresso machine the full kitchen also has a stovetop oven dishwasher andwe tried to stay here last year but covid canceled it  location and views are perfect  several cafes

station is just around the corner making the rcf an outstanding location   my friends and i stayed in a threebedroom apartment the living and dining area is beautiful from the floors to the dcor its an open space with plenty of room for all the guests two of the three bedrooms were spacious and nicely updated the apartment offered two and a half baths which was splendid for four women the third bedroom ismy husband baby and i were fortunate to stay here for 6 months due to a relocation with work where do i start the residence is simply beautiful and you could not find a better location to look out of your window and see the eiffel tower is magical what really made our stay extra special was suzan on reception she went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and part of the family even the cleaners were all so lovely and stopped to greet our baby every day we we miss them all very much especially suzan the hotel is very lucky to have her thank you residence charles floquetclean

andparis was the last stop on a month long vacation after spending 3 weeks in italy we have always stayed down in the st germain area but decided to spend a few nights here and also over at george v   i wanted to give my wife and daughter a wow moment with the view and this placed delivered that in spades  we had a superior 2 bedroom apartment where the view was spectacular i cannot comment on the views from the  classic apartments but from the website  they appear to be on lower floors this place was great whilst the atmosphere in the area was a bit sterile  the apartment was huge with a view of the eiffel tower that i do not think could be beaten in paris the apartment was spotlessly clean and very comfortable but the furnishings were tired  and the carpet very oldfirst the location of

paris vacation off to the best possible start it is the best of both worlds like an airbnb you get an entire apartment in which to spread out and like a hotel you get hotellike services including a front desk which can arrange transportation or provide a breakfast basket if you want these services we did not need breakfast but did book transportation to gare montparnasse through the front desk for the next leg of our trip very appreciated   we booked a 5 night stayjuly 2530 2021in a 3 bedroom superior apartment we got a survey before our stay to find out if we had any special requests when we arrived we found out we had been upgraded to the penthouse on the 7th floor wow  the view fromwe are a family of 7 and we stayed at this hotel which is really like an air bnb apartment in august 2021 for one week we were on the 5th floor and went to sleep each night looking out at the eiffel tower one block away from the apartment the location made it a memorable experience for our entire family also since we were vacationing for 2 weeks in europe the washerdryer in the apartment was great a grocery store is one block away from the apartment and the apartment has a refrigerator and microwave the disneyland paris bus pickup location is 3 blocks from the apartment  also convenient the free wifi in the apartment was also great  we streamed movies from amazon with no problems  i highly recommend this location for any families wanting to stay in paris for atwe stayed here back in january 2020 sorry for the late review for 8 nights  the apartment we stayed in was magnificent as was our view of the eiffel tower  definitely a parisian home feel to itview was amazing and appartement pretty clean even though maybe a bit dated we definitely plan on coming back for a family vacation price for the view is totally worth it kids love watching the eiffel tower   at night time,well what can i say if you are looking for a fabulous view and to be close to the eiffel tower these apartments tick all the right boxes easy to find and there was offstreet parking but we decided to play it safe for security and park a 10minute walk to our prebooked parking lot. We had no complaints whatsoever and it was more than adequate for one night to enjoy a day trip overall. Overall a fantastic stay and very helpful people as well highly recommended.
Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg,4 years ago i was the last time at sofitel le faubourg that time the strongest point employees and location today strongest point staff and location it is just amazing how this hotel manages to keep all their employees and they continuously manage to exceed our expectations   arriving by car after tough security check american embassy next door they parked my car took our luggage and accompanied us to the check in the newly appointed gm welcomed us personally wow and we got an upgrade into a junior suite   this is one of the only hotels which does not save cost the usual average hotel does saving on services staff amenities and with the lousy excuse due to covid we can not provide this and that but we charge you full price  yes the faubourg charges butthis hotel surpassed my expectations   it is a beautiful property furnished with exquisite taste   the location is excellent and convenient for walking to most destinations i as well as being very close to the number 1 yellow  metro line it is a very safe location as well from the very first moment the reception team welcomes you with great warmth and hospitality the two concierges jerome and thomas are excellent they are real professionals who can research any issue and are warm and very thoughtful in the extreme  i appreciated all their hard work the hotel was very cautious during covid and strict in their protocol the main restaurant was closed but i did have one meal in the bar which was very satisfactory the breakfasts were superb with great variety andthis hotel is wonderful my wife and i spent a night here for her birthday the hotel staff made the experience magical they put roses on the bed and in the bath along with candles and some cute gifts for our new baby who was home with grandma the concierge walked us to our beautiful clean room and the kitchen and cleaning staff left us hand written notes we stayed in a junior suite overlooking the courtyard nice big bathroom with bath and shower nice big king bed  a couch along the wall quiet room   we will absolutely come back strongly recommend this hotel recently stayed in this hotel for 3 nights at the end of our trip to france prior to returning home to the usa this hotel has an excellent location it is private and staff and service are excellent they are attentive to every detail concierge is very knowledgeable and very helpful including booking all the tickets for us for our museum visits and finding the right place to get a covid test prior to departure we had an upgraded room for our stay and it was very well appointed breakfast was very good onsite restaurant was fair but there are plenty of restaurants nearby that are outstanding including some michelin 3 star restaurants we had a great stay and this

champagne  cake on my wifes birthday they really care about their customers happiness  experience  fabrinna  tamara were born to be guest relations personnel often quoting if youre happy were happy the breakfast team were friendly  efficient as were laura at reception thomas the concierge  the asian doorman  well done to all the hotel staff  the hotel could be improved by removing the bed topper which is too soft and lumpy and adjusting the shower head which has weak flow and didnt reach out far enough the room however is stylish chic and comfortablewhat a great location in paris perfect for

staff lack of staff a shoe box as room no upgrade because fashion week with a tiny queen size bed that had a topper that was even smaller so you were always afraid to fall out try to sleep in that with two people probably better sleeping quality in the local ymca huge disappointmentwe recently spent a week in paris we chose this hotel because of its location it was a great choice excellent service great decor wonderful rooms we cant wait to come back if you are looking for a high quality hotel in the centre of paris  consider this hotelnormally one of our favourite sofitels but this time unfortunately extremely stressed out staff lack of staff a shoe box as room no upgrade because fashion week with a tiny queen size bed that had a topper that was even smaller so you were always afraid to fall out try to sleep in that with two people probably better sleeping quality in the local ymca huge disappointmentwe booked a deluxe room for two nightsunfortunately we had some troubles

recommend this hotel to anyonein the middle of paris perfect location professional staff rooms have pretty different shape and bathrooms are differently integrated so check before hand halls and carpets a bit run down but overall great hotelthis hotel has a nice vibe with a special charm given by all the nice mannequins with long dresses in the hall attentiveness in reception and room service should be mentioned as well as the food quality with small details such as the bread quality or coffee selection in the roomhighly recommended we stayed for 3 nights and it was faultless lovely room great breakfast and service will definitely stay again the staff were all really helpful location is great too close to place de vendome great for shopping and near the louvre this will be our regular place to stay from now onthe sofitel paris le faubourg was everything that we expected it to be and the location was fabulous our junior suite had all the room that we needed and its location was very quite buffet breakfast in the blossom restaurant was very high quality with many choices every day and the wait staff were pleasant and very accommodating  being right off of rue du faubourg saint honore is a luxury shoppers dream come true  there area is very safe and secure the street is blocked on both ends by gates and guarded by police the american embassy is on one corner and the france presidential residence is behind the hotel we felt very safe  if you are looking for a welcoming staff beautiful location and a luxury hotel then the sofitel paris le faubourg is for youwe stayed at the sofitel paris le faubourg at the beginning and end of our recent trip to france it is a beautiful hotel wonderfully located next to the place de la  concorde and the fashionable shops the tuileries garden are a stones throw away the hotel is boutique size just right for individual service that was flawless all of the staff was great but a special mention to daphne at the front desk and jerome at the concierge desk  they gave us such special attention and went out of their way to make sure that we had a perfect visit this will certainly be our goto hotel from now on in paris we always stay at a sofitel when we can they never disappoint and the sofitel le faubourg is no exception  it is simply wonderful the room was very comfortable and the bedthis is my first time writing a review because i feel strongly about this hotel i was really looking forward to staying here as the highlight of my trip and had very high expectations before coming not just my expectations were not met i am very disappointed with this hotel ok the location is great for shopping near all the high end luxury brands and its safe bec its next to the us embassy but thats it   first of all being an accor gold member we werent given any preferential treatment at all i had a bad feeling the moment we stepped out of the elevator the hallway is narrow and cheap looking second the room where should i start when we entered the room it smelled strongly of alcohol the disinfectant kind yuck as far as i know we were staying at a hotelwe had a great time here sofitel anyway you will not regret if you come lovely service if you ever come deal with the beautifulstaff they are lovely and also forgot about the great welcome that we had me and my friends well recommendeda truly beautiful hotel with great staff who are always helpful the public areas are immaculate with plenty of space to meet people and chat rooms vary depending on what you pay but they all have really comfortable beds and those facing the nside courtyard are really quietparis now has all of its former glorious deluxe hotels completely refurbished after extensive closures  the ritz crillon  bristol a perfect alternative at a fraction of the cost is the sofitel faubourg  location is perfect on rue faubourg  st honore at hermes  the police checkpoint  friendly staff modern appointments with a fashion theme gives you an upbeat trendy environment  fresh and casually stylish  a great sofitel located perfectly for the best stores and the close by the best hotelsthis hotel was wonderful for our first trip to paris  we arrived before check in time and they were able to give us our room early  the amazingly comfortable bed was just what we needed after our trip from texas  the location was perfect for shopping and with the french government security outside it felt very secure  we would definitely return to this sofitelthis hotel is a pretty standard 5 luxury hotel in all the expected ways well located good service nice room etc however there was just one part of our stay that soured our experience at the hotel  on the day of the checkout we were around 30 minutes past the checkout time when we were basically kicked out of our suite due to the fact that evidently they had to prepare the hotel for some visiting dignitaries and their retinue this left a very sour taste in my mouth as it is generally understood especially among this caliber of hotels that one has a little bit of flexibility upon checkout up to an hour  or maybe this is a french thing  but i havent had this at any of the other hotels ive been to in france or paris before regardless this experience soured myand this hotel totally contributes to this trip during the pandemic the location is amazing in the area safe and with lots shops and restaurants around in walking distance the friendly and professional staff though made the whole stay an awesome experience from the front desk to house keeping i couldnt recommend this hotel enough room is very well decorated and clean with very comfortable bed i have been to other 5 stars hotel around the area but the service arent comparable to sofitel la faubourg im definitely booking again next time i cross the tunnel to parismy son and his fianc were married in paris in late august and reserved their wedding night stay at sofitel paris le faubourg  regrettably the covid19 pandemic made inperson participation by his canadian family impossible  wanting to contribute to their special day from a distance a family member contacted the hotel to enquire about what could be done  showing great compassion and empathy for our circumstances the sofitel representatives offered several upgrades and amenities free of charge including upgrading their room to a suite and placing a bottle of champagne macarons and a beautiful flower bouquet in the suite before their arrival  in addition we purchased for each of them a lovely hotel robe which the hotels inhouse seamstress embroidered with their namestop notch keep it up i enjoy every moment my family and myself looking to come again staff kind and gentle good management good service  housekeeping very neat and polite i like all in this hotel thank younice location pleasant check in experience and beautiful property  room was clean however disappointed when the turn down service was refolding of wet towels that were left on the floor to be used again  quite unsanitary  facial tissue had about five sheets left  minor but its details what guests expect at finer hotels  breakfast had a nice selection of pastries with organic fruit juices and teas offered  service was great minus a lady who was rude when i asked for tea close to 1000   not sure if it was the language barrier but she was getting snippy asking me repeatedly what type of tea i wanted  why not give me the options available instead getting irritated  i was enjoying my breakfast until this moment  was not expecting to be talked to this way at this,4 years ago i was the last time at sofitel le faubourg that time the strongest point employees and location today strong point staff andLocation it is just amazing how this hotel manages to keep all their employees. My wife and i spent a night here for her birthday the hotel staff made the experience magical they put roses on the bed and in the bath along with candles and some cute gifts for our new baby who was home with grandma the concierge walked us to our beautiful clean room and the kitchen and cleaning staff left us hand written notes.
St Christopher's Gare du Nord Paris,when arriving to the area it felt a little dangerous however the hostel is 2min away from gare du nord so it was easy to find   regarding the hospitality  amazing

the best bartender ever and the hostel is nice everything is clean and the beds are nice  the only thing is that you have to bring your own padlock to lock your suitcase so remember to bring that didnt get to try the food just go herebarry made my night cant recommend enough i cant get into specifics even though trip advisor requires 200 character which is annoying by the way i as an irish american from new york i was honored to meet a real irish person in the beautiful city of parisbarry is the best bartender in paris cheers great bar the food was amazing drinks have good prices and they atmosphere is always great music is good and you always meet new and nice people come to belushis gare du nord asap beautiful hostel with nice people and a cool atmosphere barry made the cheese

the name of barry he was great for recommending drinks and had a great spirit made my holiday in paris great craic altogethergreat atmosphere in the bar fantastic staff  was lucky to be served by the excellent barry on our first night in the bar he made our night staff were very accommodating checking in and the hostel is very clean and in a great locationthe hostel is super fun they organize different activities for you to get to know other people also the staff is incredibly friendly and create a great atmosphere especially barry he made our stay even more enjoyable with his kindness and hospitality good food good location special regards to my friend barry the barman very very nice 100 recommended  nevertheless tripadvisor obliges me to write 200 words as minimum wich is bloody ridiculousprivate room is extremely satisfactory great location in the city with ease of access to all amenities coming from the uk we find it hard to communicate in french but the bartender barry gave us many suggestions on the local area and made our stay at the bar a great night hats off to him for great servicei usually like hostels as they are more affordable and social compared to hotels a tradeoff in comfort is part of the deal  unfortunately this hostel was not for me the signiture barnightclub of st christophers inn is located at the hart of the hostel giving al rooms with a courtyard view entertainmant throuought the night good if you like to party the night away but not if you just want a decent nights sleep  additionally i was grossed out by my pillows even though they had clean cassings the verry sharp sweat odor was unbearable   not my best hostel experiencewonderful hostel everythings clean and the people are so nice even in a 10 bed room very good to stay there  especially the barkeeper barry made us feel welcome and made sure everyone was socializing well  also the train station is 2 minutes away which was very good when ill go to paris next time i know where im gonna stayi have only had the pleasure of spending one night at the st christophers inn but i have had so much fun and made so many friends  if you are looking for parisian nightlife this is the place to go   we were given a free workshop on making mojitos by barry it was so awesome  i would recommend this hostel to any students traveling on a budget looking to have some funwe really enjoyed our recent stay at st christophers inn the hostel was perfect for our needs and located close to the train station one of the highlights of our stay in paris was an evening spent in the adjoining bar where our fellow irishman  barry made sure the drink was flowing and everyone was in good form i would definitely recommend this hostel and bar  ive been in hostels and dormitories around the world for more then 20 years i would not go back to this place it is huge and the reception seems to take it as an argument for the bathrooms to be uncleaned showers and toilets were not clean corridors have no end and you have to pass multiple doors from the elevator to finally get to your room i felt like i was sleeping in a warehouse there was no air con and some people had problems with their windows that would not open good to mention that gare du nord is a crappy neighborhoodsuch a good vibe at the hostel a perfect place to meet new people and socialise  easy when bartender barry is on the job making sure everyone is having fun and never an empty glass i can only recommend this place to all travelling by yourself or with a friendamazing staff and customer

he taught us how to make mojitos and made us feel very welcome here we met lots of people from around the world and there was just a really great vibe inside the bar with all the other travelers we hope to go to stchristophers inn in other countrieswhen we made a reservation and went to the hotel they said that it was impossible for us to pay cash and that was the procedure  another customer who was there asked to pay to help us and we were going to give him cash  but the woman at the reception said very harshly that such a thing was not possible it was our last day in paris or even in france  we were in a panic and they were never helpful  they were very rude  they took cash payment for the two people who came after us but they told us it was impossible the rudest owner people i have ever seen i am so unhappy that they made our last night so bad  i will never step foot in here againive been in hostels and dormitories around the world for more then 20 years i would not go back to this

St Christopher's Inn Canal Paris,ive stayed at st christopher inn canal in paris in august 2020 its not far from metro and and attractions are easily reached views of the canal are beautiful and morning coffee at downstairs bar terrace is a pleasant start to a busy day my room was clean had towels changed and bathroom cleaned daily all the precautions for covid19 are implemented hand sanitation stations are plenty wearing face mask in downstairs premises is compulsory bar reception cleaning team and security are wearing face covering at all times the crew is very friendly and helpful will go an extra mile to make sure they deliver excellent service now the only drawback is that theres no small fridge in private  ensuite rooms which is a complete disappointment usually august in paris havesuper histle very clean friendly and helping stuff with a bar with tv soccer hamburgers and other stuff renting knives etc whatever you wish positive people and stuff great location near the river where at the evenening people come and sit and enjoy the dayevening nearby velib rentabikes 50m from entry of hostel metro about 300k restaurants nearby also stores bakery swimming in siena river 300m away piecefully inside busy and fun outside since many bars by the river around also pretty near all parts of paris that are important inside smart offers for whatever person needs forgot a towelborrow one same with locker sleepers etc a hostel that is being developed according to the peoples needs would highly recommend it thanks for a gr8 stay and fungood size bedrooms with powerpoints cutains comfortable beds and cleaned every day bathrooms could be tidied up breakfast tasty good security friendly helpful staff location interesting metro not far awayit was fine the tables were sticky not just some literally all of the tables were sticky and all the time and it was pretty expansive but the rest was ok i guess good connection to the city alsoi really liked the hotel and the staffs are super friendly and speak a lot of languages so the communication is easy the room was very clean the only thing that i didnt like is that there is not toiletry in like shampoo the place is clean and kept well maybe separate men from women for privacy i will come back again i like the light through the rooms ventilation system may be a good idea otherwise it is good place to spend time in francei loved the room great beds with usb chargers and electric plugs for every bed  but the woman who checked us in was mean and she didnt even speak french  i think she was spanish  we decided to leave and go to another hosteli stayed two nights  this was my first stayed in a hostel i liked it it was good and clean room cheap price and good quality foods  good accommodation   comfortable beds nice coffe and pub good location  helpfull staff  only i had to say the shower does not work properly always stop each one minute  there was a button you have to touch it always and always  i thought that it is for cost savingvery clean excellent location staff are amazing and the food and drink is great definitely recommended comfortable beds and showers were excellent stunning location next to river  luggage room is very helpfulthe place looks nice and also is in the inside the room was normal comfy beed enough space to lock up your things shower ok the bar was better than spected the food very nice all the drinks you may want prices ok enough tourist information and the people nice and helpful wanna make a special mention to alvaro who is from argentina realy help me during my trip  will return one daybest waiter ever very active always running everywhere to serve and satisfy everyone puts a lot of energy in his work yves is really qualified funny and speaks good english and does really good music by the way cute hostel nice bar service superlame the the elevator was broken when i was there  i have a bad back  chose this hotel as description stated elevator  good for people with mobility issues but when the elevator broken they took no steps to makeup for thi i  asked for help at reception woman working there told me to buzzoff  toughluck about the elevator  fyi she couldnt speak french surprising at a bg paris hostel  the younger staff i met in the bar were nicer and they speak french theres a free breakfast which was average  rooms interesting podbeds wth plugs wifi works its in the seedier part of paris but i didnt feel unsafe  if they hired new staff and fixed their elevator itd be a better placei got my bag stolen at the hostel and told the reception about it when i left in case they find it back at some point they called me on the same evening to tell me that they found it i called them back on the next day to inform them that a friend of mine would pick it upwhen my friend came they told him that they threw the bag awaythen i called them everyday always getting the same answer sorry but i dont personally know about this issue please call back tomorrow until i finally got an email address to which i had to write of course two times to get the following answer  since you didnt respond to our message we threw the bag away i find it extremely dishonest and irespectuli stayed for only 1 night but the experience was very good usually hostels are not the place where you would like to stay more but this time i wished i didnt book my next place as i arrived in front of the building the entrance was visible but it goes through the bar called belushis the ambiance at the reception was welcoming and i loved how lively the bar downstairs was the food was amazing and had very competitive prices if you are staying at the hostel you get a bracelet that entitles you to 25 off your bill for food and drinks  full review on my blog link in bioattention should be given to the steps on entry and exit to the building by the front door no drinks should be taken beyond the steps unless the adequate seating and table facilities have been provided care should be taken at all times on entry and exit of the st christopher hostelperfect place to stay it was very clean and calm the staff were friendly and the food quality was almost good the restaurant had a discount for the people staying in the hotel sitting near the river and drinking and talking with friends was amazing during nighthad to wear a mask within a space i was paying for which ruined the experience staff enforced this rudely and without using common sense having paid for a place to stay i wouldve thought i would have the basic human right to breathe freely and not be harassed simply for entering without a maskhi the vibe of this hostel is immaculate simply splendid ive been her a day and im already having the time of my life also if you need a makeyourown  mojito class teacher look for barry hes funsieshad a great time at st christophers the prices in belushi bar especially barry the irish bartende he was friendly and charismatic and very forgiving of my terrible french i would 100 visit again if and when i return to parisas an irish person in paris meeting barry from collig behind the bar really made me feel at home and his  hospitality was outstanding couldnt have asked for anymore i would definitely recommend this hostel and barry behind the bar if your irishthe place is very nicea bit big for a

placegreat locationnice staff at the bar and security but an incredible number of problems during my stayno shower in my private suiteno lift with 6 floorsno water during 2 days room s door who doesnt closetoo many problems thats a shamethey gave me a 40 euros refund for thata clean well organised quiet and very very cheap hostel about 30 min from the city centre with the metro which is not much considering the size of paris the breakfast is included if you book on their website and they have a very nice barpub at the ground floor the neighbourhood is quite calm and for what i have seen not dangerous the common bathrooms are clean and there are many i would definitely recommend it for groups of friends that are planning a cheap but nice weekend in pariscovid warning  some latin staff  tend to allocate people of colour regardless of attitude in the same rooms than economically deprivated people sometimes with doubtful hygiene and without respecting the allocation of bunkbeds with reasonable distance the french managers are much more inclusive and dont base their decision on skin colour only  be careful if you care not catching covid positiveas an irish person in paris meeting barry from collig behind the bar really made me feel at home and his  hospitality was outstanding couldnt have asked for anymore i would definitely recommend this hostel and barry behind the bar if

Touring Hotel,hotel is in a great location  minutes walk from the opera garnier area and the gallery lafayette  it is a minutes walk from a metro station which then puts all of paris within easy reach   the area of the hotel is nice and feels safe   the rooms were exceptionally clean  the wifi was strong and consistent  did not fail us once while we there breakfast was delicious and filling in an old stonewalled room that felt like we were eating in an ancient room  the atmosphere was extremely quaint and relaxing    the best part  as so many other already commented is the service  the owners are so welcoming and friendly and happy to go above and beyond in answering any questions  we felt like personal gueststhis little gem is tucked away in the middle of paris it has a charm like not found in most places these days it is old school and by that i mean the only modern appliances in the rooms are the phone and tv but who needs tv when youve got t rex right there is a shared kitchen downstairs a most genial staff who are happy to help with anything and nothing is more than an hour away on foot its truly a special placewe were 6 friends for long weekend in paris  the hotel is at the 9th quieter and in very good location near 34 different metro stations many supermarkets around as well as coffee shops and restaurants the rooms are small and simple but clean and warm there is no minibar or coffee at the rooms but there is a small kitchen for the gestu with refrigerator and microwave and hot water  it is very comfortable for jewish kosher and next to chabad and other synagogue  nice and helpful staff recommendedi must say this hotel is very comfortable the office staff speak english and are very helpful the breakfast is amazing definitely highly recommend when we return to paris we are staying here oh great locationa three night stay was more than enough cons rude staff minimal amenities bad breakfast no effort to make you feel welcomed or like a guest pros decent room and bathroom size location two blocks from the metro this is a 2 star hotel at best no bottled water they recommend you drink water out of the sink need directions why do they have to repeat themselves when they told you the day before the construction noise from the neighbors no excuses or apologies tough time here but we didnt let it ruin an otherwise delightful trip just go somewhere elsevisited precovid  good location and serviced by ride shares and taxis  nice eateries close by  room was clean but a bit small  tidy small lobby nice for waiting on ground transportation

visit to paris the rooms were very comfortable and the staff were friendly and helpful the location was handy for montmartre  pigalle and the opera areas it was a few minutes walk to the cadet metro and near other stations there was access to a kitchen with a hot plate fridge and kettle the was useful for making hot drinks etc we very much enjoyed our stayas a professional in the industry i can on say this hotel is poorly managed the phone did not work you have to skip dirty linen bags in the stairs the hallway floors are repaired in a chepa sort of way but what striked me was the way they treat clients i was asked by the lady at reception to leave my key even though i was only going to breakfast when i was asked where was the ironing area she told me it was to the right of the stairs after i finished ironing there was a toilet there and i tied my tie for the wedding i was attending she comes barging in and shouts at me what are you doing here apparently i had gone down the wrong set of stairs and was in the staff toilet area i was impressed by her lack of customer service skills as i checked out she had the  nervestayed last night room number 5  a warm welcome from the staff

visited london before this and hence we were already ready for small rooms and it was no different here the rooms were comparatively smaller and the elevator even smaller barely 2 person and one luggage can fit the rooms had basic features with manual locks and one key we got locked out 2 times in the first hour and had to go to the reception to get help the shower area was also very small the common area and the dinning area were large and spacious   the breakfast buffet was filled with variety of delicious breads and pastry options they bake most of the food fresh in the hotel itself so you could smell the auroma of the food by 7 am the best part of the hotel stay even on the day of our departure we were able to have thewe stayed here for 4 nights on a recent visit visit to paris the rooms were very comfortable and the staff were friendly and helpful the location was handy for montmartre  pigalle and the opera areas it was a few minutes walk to the cadet metro and near other stations there was access to a kitchen with a hot plate fridge and kettle the was useful for making hot drinks etc we very much enjoyed our stayi stayed at this hotel for two weeks from december 11 2019 the location facilities and staff were all good   the  good things of location are as follows  15minute walk from opera garnier  15minute walk from paris north station  one minute walk to supermarket carrefour city  3minute walk to some shops where we can buy side dishes cade street  the  good things of facilities are  sufficient space  proper water pressure  clean room and bathroom  there were points such as no chain on the door no provision of drinking water no refrigerator in the room it is in the common space and no security box in the box  however these light shortcomings are eliminated by the greatness of the above advantages and the great staffs described below  i had bookedmy husband and i spent three nights at the touring hotel when celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and could not have been more pleased with our choice every person we had contact with was courteous professional helpful and warm the room was beautifully appointed and the mattress the most comfortable i have ever slept on in a hotel to top it off the breakfast each morning was superb fresh pastries homemade each day in addition to other staples such as fruit cheeses and eggs provided the perfect start to our day as an example one morning we were seated and already eating when a woman walk out of the kitchen with a fresh loaf of brioche to offer us ten minutes later a man came by our table offering fresh crepes and the croissants were the freshest and flakiest istayed at the hotel for three nights  the clerks at the front desk were super helpful  very professional  the breakfast was outstanding  location was good  louve  is about 20 minute walk  the room was small but very comfortable  we could open the windows to get fresh air which was nice  i would highly recommend this locationi booked through trip advisor and i would do so again rooms are small but perfect for travelers customer service is amazing easy access to metro when they arent on strike also easy to book an uber the small bread stores within a block are to die for i would return againonly made the booking 2 days before for a last minute holiday staff were incredibly helpful and friendly hotel was clean accessible and very central 2 metros within 2 minutes walk also around a 20 min walk to train station for the airportnice friendly hotel great for exploring central paris for jewish travelers kosher breakfast yummy croissants self boil eggs every day also for fridaysaturday candles hotplates urns and plastic plates and cutlerythis adorable family owned hotel had so much character and was perfect for our first time visit to paris the staff was beyond helpful and kind with directions and tips to explore paris we felt safe and the convince of the metro close by was an extra plus when we checked out we were apologized to for no ac we told them we didnt even notice staying here made it for a wonderful memory of paristhe hotel is in need of an update but the location and price is right  there is no air conditioning or ceiling fans which is a problem in summer it has central courtyards that visitors use as smoking areas and the smell and smoke does drift up and into rooms however there is a kitchen that can be handy a breakfast option that is plentiful and the staff are friendly and helpful the owner said that the competition of airbnb he intends to include extra features like a fridge in the room at some point i would stay there againthis is a good 3 star kosher hotel conveniently located in the 9th arrondissement they offer a fully kosher buffet breakfast for 10  per person daily  they do not offer shabbat meals but they set out candles for fri night a white tablecloth in the dining room for meals and a plata for keeping food warm  there are a number of groceries nearby where tzkeout meals canbe purchased and brought back to be warmed up friendly clean and umpretentious it handles most of the needs of the kosher traveler in a very convenient location close to metro stops and synagogueswe loved this hotel we spent three days at this hotel and loved it for its excellent service and friendly reception its quaint bedroom with shuttered balcony overlooking a synagogue with its historical commemoration to  the holocaust  unfortunately i discovered this too late to take in a visit of the adjoining building  this hotel is located in a quiet street and it is loaded with quaint charm and architectural interest and its foyer lounges of which there are two are inviting and very comfortable breakfast buffet is included  the breakfast room is downstairs to what was probably the basementcellar previously and includes gorgeous stone walls and arched cellar doorways the breakfast selection is generous and you must try their croissants  they are the real thingthe touring hotel is conveniently located between 2 metro stops in a neighborhood with lots of restaurants a supermarket and a launderette  the hotel is a small older property and relatively inexpensive  the staff was friendly and helpful  our room was small by american standards but well maintained and comfortable  the lack of ac was not an isuue in october but might well be in the summer  breakfast was served in a lovely room in the basement  there were fried eggs rolls cheese fruit coffee etc and it proved a good start for the day  wed stay againwe stayed at this hotel for four nights where checkin right away the owner is very nice and informative we stayed in room 18 on the fourth floor facing the street the room is very basic but clean and the was comfortable and bathroom was adequate and big enough the problem was that somebody with chip hammer would wake us up every morning at about 8 am because there was no ac only fan the metro stations and the opera house was very close  the hotel is very basic but very good location and the staff are wonderfuli spent 3 lovely days in paris in october as part of a european vacation  the hotel is located on a quiet street in the 9th arrondissement a beautiful area with fabulous haussman architecture  the hotel room was small by american standards but clean and comfortable nice hot shower  the room

elkordywarwick paris was one of my favorite hotel in all paris  if you scroll down youll see a previous preview about that hotel unfortunately i dont know what exactly happened to them but its going down every year  it became overpriced and getting old and also staff lost their smile that i used to see it asked to empty the minibar in the kids room and the answer is 20  asked for converter again the answer is always the hotel has an amazing location right next to champslyses the room was spacious and very clean the breakfast is great with a lot variety  the staff is super friendly and extremely helpful   i would totally recommend this hotelour two week trip to paris down the rhone to nice turned into a three day trip shortly after our arrival the viking counselor what else could i call bernard told us we could stroll to the seine and see the eiffel tower so we did pictures and all took us to it when the lights came on then across the river to come back on the other side  stopping at a sidewalk restaurant we lingered till after deep dark then meandered toward the warwick  within a block of the hotel my wife fell and broke her knee being french she walked back  arriving we were surrounded by the staff with compassion and love poured forth in the form of ice and then a wheel chair and then reservations at the 8th floor restaurant where usually reservations are needed but not for us we iced overnight location is perfect  very near from champs  staff are friendly and very helpful specially mrs sophia  mrs gabrielle good support to the guest and professionalism in serving the hotel guest   hotel very clean  secure  hotel near from restaurants and cafes    all facilities are availablethe warwick hotel in paris is a good hotel to stay in its location is very nice and very close to the champs elysees street rooms are not that large but very clean staff and services are very good breakfast is goodafter all the great reviews i was deeply disappointed in what i witnessed in this aging hotel with obvious signs of damage and despair  the pictures attached to my review should speak volumes for what i found when staying at the warwick  im writing this more as an appeal to the management to pay attention invest in repairs and hopefully make this right for future guests  quite honestly i was somewhat embarrassed to conduct business here  to the management please restore this otherwise charming facility and return it to its former glory  your guests depend upon this as home away from home while on the road give them fond memories by taking care of the upkeep pleasegood hotel  right on the champs elysee george v metro station  etc  decent sized rooms  friendly staff but  not all came back at 1130 pm by a cab and he had no change  asked the old man at the front desk to spare 5 euro and charge ma room  he said he cant i gave 100 eur and said keep this and give me 5 to clear the cab guy he said no he cant really   whatver accounting  petty cash

hotel outstanding professional friendly staff specially sofia and vincent  i will defenitely be back  my best regards to themnice hotel right besides the arche of triomphe the bed is all but soft the old house is not really silent in the night and the carpet is not the newest but at the end of the day i find the price justified trough emplacement good materials and size of the room and if you are not too sound sensible  you can easily sleep here a night or twothe hotel is in a great location the hallways are a bit weathered the room was quite nice the elevators were quite weathered as well there are really no views from any part of the hotel having said all that i would stay there againwithout a doubt on of the best hotels i have ever been too staff is amazing especially the reception and the concierge they help you in all the ways they can they always find the way the stay was great a true sample of excellent hospitality i really recommend this hotel what a grand hotel stunning the staff could not have been better reception were so helpful and we cant complain about anything i would go back without any hesitation very clean what a wonderful experiencei spent 2 nights at the warwick to celebrate my 50th birthday with my husband  excellent location right by the champs elysees staff and customer service very good i received  a bottle of champagne fruit and macaroons on my birthday from the hotel which was a lovely gesture  we had a lovely stay  thank you for making my birthday extra specialroom 319 a comfortable room with fine facilities the lobby lounge is full of activity and its a perfect place to meet and talk the lounge offers a huge plate glass window to the world looking out over rue de berri with its constantly changing vista of the passing urbane and cosmopolitan french crowd the warwick offers excellent breakfast in the restaurant with wonderful service from the staff jerome is a standout maitre de nothing is too much trouble and his english is first class as is the coffee he servesthey ask me if i need a taxis to the airport  i said yes and they call me a taxis i paid 110 euros instead of 53 euros i suspect them of scheming with the reception not to mention the rooms with water leaks every time i asked for a taxis its always the same people who came in short i got ripped off for the airport and for disney i paid 200 euros the reception sucks reallyi have never written a review on trip advisor but i felt like i needed to warn people about this hotel i have traveled all over europe the past couple months staying in 10 different hotels this was by far the worst experience  great location yes as it is very close to the champs elysees good sized rooms check safe indeed we are two girls traveling so safety was very important price expensive but we thought it would be worth it we were excited to enter the last stint of our travels and enjoy our first time in paris but this hotel did not make it easy for us first off the receptionist was utterly rude and curt to me and my sister upon arrival it was as if we were below him possibly because we were women or americans then walking through the hallway therei spent

second stay in one year the first was good but the second turned out terrible and their customer service was extremely unfriendly and not customer oriented am not gonna stay in this hotel againwe have chosen this hotel based on guests reviews and nearest to champs elysees     the check in process was very smooth and fast as our three superior queen rooms were ready and allocated prior to our arrival which is a professional act from the hotel      the hotel staff are very friendly  and cooperative  we had warm welcome by all staff       the hotel location as stated by previous guests is excellent in the heart of champs elysees       the room was clean with reasonable size  theres no ironing service in the room tell you order it  the bed pillows are not comfortable there is no drinking water provided in the room even complementary one unless you pay  requesting to empty the mini bar will cost you  60        the breakfast is okay but there is not much,warwick hotel in paris
