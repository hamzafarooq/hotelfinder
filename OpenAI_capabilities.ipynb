      "Great hotel! Truly enjoyed the location and the staff! The hotel is located very closely to the metro and múltiple bus stops. It is about a 10 minute walk from the Seine River. There are multiple shops and restaurants around the area. It is close enough to be near multiple tourist spots but not to close to be overran  by tourists. The staff is excellent! Very helpful and accommodating. Gave us whatever we needed and helped us schedule a taxi for our drive to the airport. The room was a little small, but I could look past this because of how amazing everything else was.\n",

You can walk across to the Seine River as well. Within the close vicinity there are bakeries, restaurants and retail stores. Check-in could be more cheerful :)\n",

      "The hotel is well located in the French Quarter so you can walk, metro or get citi-bikes to go anywhere.  Bakeries, food shops, brasseries right out the door.  Steps from the Seine.  The rooms are clean and modern, with lots of plugs.  We had large room with a balcony and great view.  The staff was helpful and friendly.  Free afternoon drinks & snacks.\n",

      "We've recently had a four night stay at the hotel, which we would definitely use again. The hotel is very close to the main Sorbonne University in a vibrant, but not noisy, area. There were a few plumbing issues with the wash hand basin, otherwise the room and hotel were perfect with even afternoon snacks provided free of charge. The location is within five minutes stroll of two metro stations plus it's an easy amble down to the le Seine and Notre Dame Cathedral. The staff were all friendly and made huge allowance for our appalling French by answering in English! All in all, an excellent choice.\n",

      "I cannot recommend this hotel any higher.  It's a small hotel only minutes walk from the river and Notre Dame.  The rooms are compact but spotlessly clean and modern.  We had three rooms booked and two of them had beautiful balconies giving views over the city.  Downstairs, in the same building, is a cafe/restaurant called Cosmo where it's happy hour almost all day.  The food is excellent and the staff couldn't be nicer. I will certainly be back.\n",

      "Lovely small hotel in the BEST LOCATION close to the Seine and Saint Germain. It is a short walk to the Musse D'Orsay, Louvre, and Concorde via the river and Notre Dame via Saint Germain's winding streets. If you enjoy walking you can also go on foot to the Eiffel Tower. It is such a lovely area you could spend your whole trip here. The staff were very keen to help and it is worth enjoying your private daily slot at the Spa.The room was small but very well designed for optimum use, with lots of space in the wardrobe, room for cases and well designed bathroom.\n",

      "Great location for walking to the sites, warm staff, great breakfast. The rooms were small, but that's what you get for a boutique hotel down the street from the seine river and a 4 minute walk to the heart of St Germain. The hotel also has a cool history... 1911 when the Mona Lisa was stolen from the Louvre, the thief and the painting spent the night in this location. Good thing she is back because we had an easy walk from the hotel to meet her.\n",

Notre-Dame is very close, about 10 minutes walk, and the river Seine is a beautiful to walk along, especially at night. The Paris Catacombs are also about a half hours walk south. We only stayed for a night, so these places were the easiest to get to for a short stay. \n",

      "Really enjoyed staying at this hotel.  The staff were all so nice and helpful. The location is amazing - social neighborhood with cafes and restaurants, walkable to the Seine and major attractions, less than 5 minutes to metro (which gets you anywhere).  The room was very nice and decor was traditional french. Very modern bathroom.  The rooms aren't huge, but we were upgraded to a slightly larger room which helped a lot. Lots of convenient outlets for charging phones, laptops, portable chargers, etc.  For a 3 star hotel in Paris, I found this to be a fantastic value. My only negative comment is that the wifi wasn't always reliable.\n",

      "Great hotel! Truly enjoyed the location and the staff! The hotel is located very closely to the metro and múltiple bus stops. It is about a 10 minute walk from the Seine River. There are multiple shops and restaurants around the area. It is close enough to be near multiple tourist spots but not to close to be overran  by tourists. The staff is excellent! Very helpful and accommodating. Gave us whatever we needed and helped us schedule a taxi for our drive to the airport. The room was a little small, but I could look past this because of how amazing everything else was.\n",

      "Lovely small hotel in the BEST LOCATION close to the Seine and Saint Germain. It is a short walk to the Musse D'Orsay, Louvre, and Concorde via the river and Notre Dame via Saint Germain's winding streets. If you enjoy walking you can also go on foot to the Eiffel Tower. It is such a lovely area you could spend your whole trip here. The staff were very keen to help and it is worth enjoying your private daily slot at the Spa.The room was small but very well designed for optimum use, with lots of space in the wardrobe, room for cases and well designed bathroom.\n",

      "Great location for walking to the sites, warm staff, great breakfast. The rooms were small, but that's what you get for a boutique hotel down the street from the seine river and a 4 minute walk to the heart of St Germain. The hotel also has a cool history... 1911 when the Mona Lisa was stolen from the Louvre, the thief and the painting spent the night in this location. Good thing she is back because we had an easy walk from the hotel to meet her.\n",
