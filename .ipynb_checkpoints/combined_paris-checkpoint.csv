So this trip I chose to stay in the first arrondissement. The location is a block from the Form les Halles and about 2 blocks from the Pompedieu Center. This made it super easy to get anywhere from the massive chatelet les halles metro station. You also can easily walk to Notre Dame, the Louvre and other sites. The room i stayed in a double room was very spacious be European and everything was updated and very nice. The staff, in particular, Farid were very helpful. The breakfast was good and they will make you an omelet. Really no negatives although took them a while to get the rooms cleaned, but minor in the big picture. I would definitely stay here again."

The location is truly exceptional, with easy access to the sights on foot or via subway, and to the airport via RER train. Neighborhood is very lively, and I felt very safe walking alone at night. My room was tiny but very well appointed and charming. The bathroom was large and well equipped, with great water pressure. Closet capacity was very good. What really caught my attention were the in-room amenities: a powerful stand-alone hair dryer, good quality toiletries,  an expresso machine and electric kettle with plenty of supplies. Breakfast was yummy if a bit pricy."

We walked to Notre Dame, Louvre and Champes Elysees. Rooms were on the small side, with a closet, a desk and of couple chairs. We had a corner room and on the weekends you could hear noise from nearby restaurants, till late. We got used to it after the 1st night. Nice size bathroom. Breakfast was excellent.

The location of this hotel is possibly the best you could wish for in Paris with Les Halles and Étienne Marcel metro stations within 3-5 minutes walk and the RER from CDG airport stopping in Les Halles. The room is very well appointed with tea & coffee making facilities, a fully stocked mini bar, safe and wardrobe, well sized en-suite and television. The hotel has a lift and restaurant, although we did not use the restaurant ourselves. The room, and hotel in general, is very clean and well presented and the staff are friendly and very helpful. I would highly recommend the Relais Des Halles and will definitely stay there again if/when we return to the wonderful city."

I really loved the size of the rooms and the free pocket wifi that the hotel provided, as well as the price point and location of the hotel. The drawbacks were that the room faintly smelled like cigarettes, it was a non-smoking room but I think that the walls were thin next to the building beside the hotel, or smoking from the street below wafted up. It was enough to make me feel sick a few times. Also, the hotel room was stifling hot at night, and we had to sleep with the windows open, which led to noise at all times of the night in our room. The hotel is located on a very busy street, which is great, but it is noisy until about 2 or 3 am most nights. One morning I woke up at about 6"

We arrived slightly early for check in and asked if they would hold our bags. Luckily our room was ready so they checked us in early which was fab! When we got to our room we were not disappointed. The room was light and had lots of space for the two of us. The bathroom was spotless- I’m very picky with bathrooms and I could not find one fault. You are even provided with a pot full of ear plugs, cotton buds and any little extra you may have forgotten to bring. There is even a shower puff provided! It’s the small touches that make a hotel feel welcoming. There was a Bluetooth speaker, an iPad, kettle and a mini fridge with a mini bar available. The staff were friendly and always offered us bottles of water for our days out. Our room was"

The location is about as good as it gets. It's a 5 minute walk from all the Metro and RER lines at Chatelet-Les Halles (which means you can take the RER B train from CDG, take exit 3 out of the station, and walk a few minutes to get to the hotel). The neighborhood that the hotel's in is lively and interesting, and it's just a short walk to some very nice shopping streets like Rue Montorgueil and Rue Rambuteau.   The staff was very welcoming and knowledgeable. I really appreciate that they were able to check us in and get us into our room, even though we arrived very early. That was a nice start to our stay. I thoroughly enjoyed the history lesson one of the men on the front desk gave"

Location is fabulous in the heart of Paris.   The rooms were spacious in terms of Paris location, cleanliness was exceptional,amenities first class,  breakfast was delicious and fresh and the staff could not be more accommodating. In particular -  the front desk where we would like to thank Mr Romar who went above and beyond expectations in assisting us from sharing local knowledge, organizing tickets and helping coordinate transport during the strike.  I could not recommend highly enough."

Excellent little hotel. The staff is very nice and helpful. The rooms are not too large, but comfortable and very clean. Excellent beds and bathrooms. Breakfast is also quite nice. Our room on the third floor was quiet.  Metro Etienne Marcel is less than 5 minutes away. The Georges Pompidou Center is 5 minutes away on foot; the Louvre is 12 minutes away;  the d'Orsay Museum is about 30 minutes away. The hotel is located within the pedestrian zone with many interesting shops, restaurants, and bars. The only sortcoming is also related to the location: we had to go to a nearby busy corner to get a taxi or an Uber.  Some drivers can figure out how to get to the hotel door, some cannot figure it out."

The room was lovely and well organized. The bathroom was spacious and the shower was very good. The beds were comfortable. I was on the 5th floor and the elevator was convenient. My only complaint is the noise... If you sleep with the windows closed noise will not be a problem. The windows are pretty soundproof.  I prefer to sleep with the windows open so noise was a problem for me. The area has lively bars and can be quite noisy - especially if there is a soccer match - well into the evening (midnight). On the whole, I was very happy with this hotel and would certainly return. It is a great value. I arrived via RER B from CDG - The trip was fast and easy."

This boutique hotel really delivers. Everyone at the front desk was helpful and courteous. The room was small but had plenty of storage for our luggage/clothes and toiletries. The bathroom was quite large for Paris. We booked our room with breakfast included, and we were quite happy we did. It was very good with lots of choices (eggs made to order if you wanted, too).  The hotel is located in a lively area and unless you need to sleep with the window open, you'd never know it. We were on the 2nd floor and the noise was not a problem at all, even on the weekend. It was centrally located with the metro 150 ft from the front door and amazingly convenient to travel to the airport by train if you choose that instead of their car"

We were there for 6 nights.

First of all it’s small and beautifully appointed.  Secondly, it is located within walking distance of EVERYTHING! Metro stops, St. Eustache, Chatelet Halles, the Louvre, the Pompideau, Rue Monteguiel, the Opera, etc.  Can’t be beat.  They also provide a very substantial and delicious made to order breakfast in their lower level cave.

The only downside is that until 1:00 at night there is noise from the street and also around 7:00 in the morning there is noise. And there is no air conditioner on cooling, (there is only in summer) so must open the window (and so the noise sounds louder)"

Free wi fi was speedy and an added bonus was the complimentary tea, coffee,water and soft drinks that were available in the room and in the reception area. Also available in reception for free were a selection of cakes and biscuits to have with your teas and coffees. The hotel was just 2 minutes walk from St George's Metro ( line 4) and a 5 minute walk from Pigalle Metro with the Moulin Rouge and Sacre Couer close by. There were several restaurants , bistros and cafes within 200 metres of the hotel. It was only an €8 taxi ride from Gare du Nord Station.  Highly recommended."

This was my first time doing a European trip. The hotel staff made my trip a success… they were super accommodating. The day staff are the best.  Not to mention the hotel was next to everything( nightlife, popular bars/restaurants, train station and buses)….I also did a tour with was organized by the staff. I asked soooooooo many questions and they answered everything. Did I say I love the hotel… it’s very whimsical which goes great with my goofy personality, lol… I would advice any female traveling solo to Paris to come to this area and this hotel."

From moment you set foot inside this hotel you feel welcome, up until the day you leave.   The room was very clean and fitted with comfortable beds. The fact that you can take a cold drink out of the included, free off charge, minibar is a real nice feature after a long day of exploring paris and its beautiful tourist attractions.   We also made use of the breakfast, in my opinion the breakfast serves everyones needs. And is very versatile.    So all these thing and the fact that the staff was very helpful and kind, lets us believe this hotel is an absolute great choice!"

Clean, friendly, close to great restaurants.  Location is perfect, if you want to feel ‘local’ but close enough to walk to the Louvre in less than 30 minutes (or Metro if your lazy).  All staff were helpful without exception.  Would definitely rebook when I return.  Paris was a break I really needed and throughly enjoyed."

George Astotel had the friendliest staff that made you feel like you were walking into your own apartment back home. Shoutout to the gentleman with glasses at the front desk for greeting us every morning with a smile and helping us with how to get around the city! You have two metro stations within walking distance to take you pretty much anywhere you want to go in Paris! Staying at a luxurious hotel does not give you the true feeling of what it’s like to be in Paris and experience the life of its locals!

Little extras like free soft minibar in our room and free afternoon soft drinks and snacks (available in other hotels of the same chain if we wanted). The location was good, lots to do nearby in terms of shopping a restaurants, 20 min walk from the Louvre.  Breakfast was really good by Paris standards, lots of choice and fresh.  I would definitely stay here again."

A lot had mentioned in other reviews ask for a room onto the inner courtyard, but I prefer onto the street,. There are two sets of doors, both tripled glazed onto the street, so when closed both I heard nothing.  The hygience was better than some 5 star hotels I have stayed in and my room was very recently renovated with a perfect bathroom, bed and bed linen.  Of course, as usual room size was quite small, but that is the deal in Paris everywhere. My single room had a very good quality firm double bed and enough"

I do live in a city in the US, but I liked being somewhere that seemed like it was true Parisians and not just other tourists. There are multiple metro stations close to the hotel, and as it was my first time in Paris, all of the tourist sites were never more than a 20 minute metro ride away, tops.

Not sure why this gets such raving reviews.  The room has funky decor. It may be to your taste or it may not. Bed was very comfortable, and the room was quiet. Our room had no view at all, just a claustrophobic courtyard.  The elevator is the tiniest thing I have seen yet in Paris. Plan on one person w/luggage or two witnout. If you have a big suitcase I doubt it will fit, unless you send it up by itself.  Breakfast here is a definitely a miss. And the street the hotel is on is a little sketch. Not the most interesting or convenient neighborhood either, unless you have specific business here (which we did).  +1 star as Ryan at the front desk was very friendly and accommodating.

Our room had its own garden couryard area. The room was fine and beds were comfortable. The hotel is in an unpolished part of Paris but only 5mins from metro station. It is also easy to walk into city centre towards the Marais. The hotel offers free tea and coffee in the reception room on the ground floor where breakfast is served. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful. Would certainly consider returning.

The lobby looked rather shabby instead of trendy with a disorganized welcome desk at the entrance. It that sense it is overrated on this site or other review sites.  Rooms definitely not spotless with greasy hand and fingerprints on tv screen, bed, door, windows etc. The lovely little terrace of room 11 was simply not cleaned for a long long time. Sheets etc were ok but with carpet on the floor I am not sure how tidy it was in general.  Breakfast was ok, but at 9h30 they ran out of stuff (yoghurts, baguette...) saying ‘sorry it’s sunday’ (??). Bread or croissants weren’t fresh but frozen stuff. Knowing you are in Paris this is disappointing.  Staff was friendly though and rooms quiet. Beds rather hard and"

I’ve given the motel 3 stars and will explain the aspects that have earned them a star:  1) Staff - staff were very pleasant to deal with and did a great job with cleaning the room daily, making sure we had fresh towels, etc. In addition to the staff, there is a gorgeous black cat named Clarinette who lives at the motel although she doesn’t go into rooms or dining area.

The staff is so helpful, and the rooms are so quiet, which seems amazing being so close to the busy boulevard.  I love the atmosphere, the breakfast, the quiet music of Chopin playing in the background.  And now there is a chat noir, ""Clarinet,"" who is a lovely presence as well.  Thank you so much for everything!"

The rooms are not big (although we’ve experienced smaller)  but are comfortable and clean. The breakfast at 10 euros was good value including cereal, fruit,  fresh juice, yoghurt, pastries and baguettes. Metro lines and an array of restaurants and cafes in the vicinity. You could pay far more and do far worse than this hotel run by nice people."

The breakfast was poor and the same every day. It is like a bad dormitory. Disgusting!"

It's a very comfortable hotel with a modern vibe in an absolutely  superb location. We liked the cool decor.   The nice, fluffy slippers that used to await you in your room after check-in are gone now, and the water glasses have been replaced by plastic ones. Also, no more all-day espresso and croissants that used to be available in the downstairs lounge - gone, probably due to Covid. Still, we were happy there, especially in our 6th floor room that had a tiny terrace with a nice view. All the rooms are small but have plenty of storage space..   One negative: the rooms are frequently not cleaned until later afternoon/early evening which makes coming home for a break in the afternoon, especially on a hot day, to take a shower,"

The first things I noticed was the chic and modern style of the hotel, and how each room has a different theme. I spent my first few weeks in a red room on the 3rd floor, and I absolutely loved it. My favorite part of the room was the huge bathroom.  On my third month, the staff upgraded me to a double room with a balcony on the 6th floor. It was bright, and had a fantastic view of the 6th floor, I quickly made this room my home.  The place is very tidy, and staff are always so accommodating and friendly, and they treated me like family. I especially enjoyed"

We were forced to leave the hotel because of the US stopping domestic flights and France closing their borders. We had three nights including breakfast left and management won’t even give us a credit to use in November of this year. I REFUSE to stay here again because of this horrible customer service beyond anyone’s control.   Had they given us a credit I would have happily started here again despite the very small rooms, lack of hot water in the evenings, and mediocre breakfast. The staff was friendly but I cannot tolerate or stomach such greed - take your money elsewhere."

We love the location, very close to metro and RER. Plenty of places to eat a good dinner, coffee, pastries and near plenty of little grocery stores for snacks. We stayed in the St Germain de Pres Room and it was adorable! We loved the views and city noise ( it wasn't excessive, but if you like a quieter room, they may be able to accommodate )  Everyone employee we encountered at the hotel was friendly and helpful. Everyone spoke 3 languages, quite impressive!  We would stay here again and recommend this place to family + friends! Thank you so much Hotel Le M for a wonderful stay!"

Checkin was nice and easy and the girl on reception was very friendly and accommodating, but otherwise the service was generally lacking. Emailed the hotel 5 days prior to arriving and only got a response 1 day prior to arriving. Guys on reception generally sounding unfriendly and like any question was interrupting them.

And I must say, I could not be happier that I chose them.  Upon arrival, on a rainy wednesday afternoon, I was received by Marie at the reception, who took care of my check in, giving my advices and tips to get around Paris, as well as explaining rules and functioning of the hotel itself. Kindly, I was informed that the room I could not have been given the room I had asked due to different categories, but that I was put into the most similar one corresponding to my category.

The location is outstanding. I have previously stayed in this area---right next door at the Hotel Saint Jacques, in fact.  This was my first stay at this hotel. I booked this hotel for my sister and myself (two single rooms) on Expedia with breakfast included. We arrived very early in the day so our rooms were not ready. We went out and about while the hotel locked our luggage in a secure room. Upon return at around 3pm, our rooms were ready. The staff were very pleasant. When I went into my room, it was fine. Nothing spectacular, nothing ornate. The room was very basic--a bed, a closet with shelves, and a desk with a chair. It was not huge,"

The location is great, centrally located in the Latin Quarter, very close to Notre Dame, and easy walking to many attractions.  Yes, the rooms are small but for location, this is a perfectly acceptable amount of space. My husband and our three LARGE bags had no issues. If you’re expecting a large hotel room, try paying 1000€ a night!   I’m reviewing this hotel mostly for the FANTASTIC service of the front desk staff. Marie, Ariane, and the others went beyond any expectations to make sure we were comfortable, ordered taxis, confirmed “local” not tourist prices, and more. I know Americans expect French people, and particularly Parisians, to be rude but I was so incredibly pleased with the staff at Hotel Le M and"

I knew I would not be able to check in until later, but I just wanted to have my suitcase put in a storage closet until later in the day when I would be allowed to check in. You would have thought I asked for a million bucks. The desk clerk was sarcastic and rude. He did put the bags in a closet finally but then I got a lecture about ""showing up early."" After checking in, I was told that any time I left the hotel I had to leave my key at the front desk. That was  annoying.

We were impressed from the very beginning by the fantastic location (right by the metro), the courteous, knowledgeable and super helpful staff, snacks in the lobby (and free water, juice & tea in the room), the tiny but lovely room itself, the complementary umbrellas, and the attention to cleanliness and comfort.  The beds and linens were comfortable, and the air conditioning was a welcome amenity.  Breakfast was adequate (a bit repetitive on the hot entrees and the coffee could use improvement), with decent variety.  All in all a bright, cheerful, clean, comfortable, and convenient place with good people in it. We're"

In the past, I rented small apartments. But now that I’ve found this amazing boutique hotel, it’s my new home in The City of Light. It’s beautiful, clean, comfortable and quiet. A huge plus is the level of professionalism and consideration displayed by every member of its staff. It’s location in the marais is perfect. The courtyard of this quaint former Hotel Particular is so inviting, as one sits at a table enjoying coffee or a cocktail, you’ll see several passersby pause to take a photo or take note to come back on their next stay. Paris is a wonderful destination, but any large and bustling city can be a “bit much” after a long day of sightseeing or meetings. The Jobo is a respite. I cannot wait to return to Paris and this perfect hotel."

It is classy, eclectic, modern, sophisticated and edgy all rolled into one.  We spent a couple of nights last year and loved it so much that we decided to come back this year as a treat to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. We fell in love with the Junior Suite, so charming and well designed.  The staff is very nice, accommodating and professional.  The location is great, right in the heart of the Quartier du Marais known as the Fashion district full of designer boutiques and great restaurants. It’s also situated less than 5 mn away from the best subway line (ligne 1) of the Paris metro transit that gets you to many of the top Paris sights. We will definitely come back. I highly recommend it!"

We don't have enough words to express our appreciation. Everyone can talk about great location and beautiful decor but I would like to stress upon unbelievably awesome warm welcome and service provided by Cyril, Catherine, Gaston and others (apologize for not remembering all names). This team is amazing - they not only guided us through the map of Paris but provided fantastic food and shopping recommendations. We were greeted with the same warmth and smiling faces at early morning or midnight. They truly made our stay memorable. If we ever come back to Paris again, THE HOTEL DE JOBO is the place we are staying."

Tiny elevator, tiny corridors, and tiny tiny room. We only had space to circulate in & out of the room/bathroom, and around the bed. The water temperature in the shower was constantly going a little colder & hotter, and we could hear our neighbors a little too well...  The staff was impeccable though!"

Started off with a surprise delivery of roses from my boyfriend (which the hotel coordinated for him), and continued with constant kindness and helpfulness from hotel staff.

Aside from the location being perfectly situated in the Marais and near the metro, the service, rooms, and everything about it - people, food, decor, water pressure, romance - was better than anything we’ve experienced on a trip in a long time. The help from Catherine and the others at the front, from making reservations, obtaining ticket passes, etc far surpassed expectations and their advice was tailored to our tastes, not to arrangements they have with certain restaurants etc."

Unfortunatly this time it's impossible. The room was cleaned and nice, but the bathroom continuously awashed a lot creating difficulties (also the moquette in the room got wet) and we hadn't bathfoam in the shower (only a soap, nothing more). I selected two single beds, choising the hotel because there was this possibility, and there were only matrimonial solutions (no one advised me before arrival or tried to help me in, this request, nor for the bathroom problems). The situation was absolutly discomfortable."

I was in one of the suites which consists in a living room, bedroom, bathroom and separate toilet. Overall, the room was very clean, looked new and comfortable. A few details could be improved to high standard: the bath curtain was not functioning properly, the sliding door between living room and bedroom was not functioning properly. There were plastic glass in bathroom, it should be replaced with normal glass to reduce plastic consumption. Same for coffee/tea, would be better to have a normal cup. The trend is to be more green but I didn't feel that trend. The entrance door opens with a key - I think it would be easier and feel more modern to have a card key to open doors too.  But again, don't get me wrong, this is"

Daumesnil metro station just around the corner and a short ride takes you into the heart of Paris and all the major tourist attractions.   I had a nice double room spacious for a solo traveler.   However there were cigarette burns in the curtains and part of the skirting board had been damaged, roughly repaired but not repainted.   Also the shower head dripped constantly and loudly.  I did report the shower head problem to reception but it was still dripping when I checked out.These are minor criticisms but they should be addressed as first impressions are very important to guests.  However I no hesitation in recommending Hotel Lequartier and would certainly stay there again."

The room are quiet and up to date with electric plugs that conform to any device you  might have.  Breakfast was wonderful with a good selection and made-to-order eggs. The only down side we encountered was a very late cleaning of our room after a long day sightseeing, but the staff sent a cleaning crew to the room very quickly.

When addressing it with the front desk, they told me I should have put a sign on the front door saying do not distribute. It turns out that housekeeping opened our door; in my opinion, NO ONE should walk into your room without knocking!!! I do not care if it house keeper or room service; they should always knock!

The room itself was a bit on the small side, but otherwise pretty nice, with a decent bathroom (no tub, but only shower though).

If you are looking to stay in the 16th, you can’t beat this location. Easy walking distance to the tower and the Seine for sure, and not far to Bois de Boulogne the other direction. Also a very short walk to the Metro for everything else. Rue de Passy itself is lovely, especially at night as it has overhead lights all the way along with many restaurants on close proximity. The room I had was spacious enough, clean and comfortable and with a reasonably priced minibar. The courtyard view meant it was very quiet. Nice modern bathroom.

To the Arc de Triomphe it's less than 5 minutes walk. We were really amazed and took the opportunity to visit the Arc de Triomphe many times last weekend. Thanks a lot to the whole Raphael team, we had a great time."

The room is great, spacious, even huge, roof top beautiful. Great breakfast too. But there are many carpets and even fabric on the wall, the one in the wardrobe then smells a lot. I got a horrible allergy, especially when I turned on the air conditioner.  On the third day, barely breathing, I went down at night and asked a nice man if there was an alternative, he wrote down my name and asked me to look for them in the morning to see if they could do a better cleaning or if there was a room with less smell .  The gentleman told me it was ""hotel style"". That all rooms were the same. I saw another friend in a room that at least had no fabric on the wall like mine. NOTHING WAS MADE.  I complained again the next day with another attendant. They were to return me."

They also got us reservations where ever we asked and knew about all the museums and sights. And don't miss the rooftop bar!

The suite was large, elegant, and refined, furnished with many antiques  We enjoyed two bathrooms, a large sitting room, and all the extras anyone could ask for.

The location is excellent -- right by the Etoile with lots of connections by metro to the rest of Paris.

They provided recommendations to pharmacies that gave COVID tests (be aware that not all pharmacies know the rules to re-enter the US).  On the negative side, their restaurant only served cold food as it is not fully opened since COVID.  I am sure that this will change over time.  I would definitely return again."

Our trip was planned for March 2020 and was completely canceled due to having to quarantine 14 days and just to be safe - after all, it was the beginning of the pandemic and we were planning to travel with children. We did not ask for a refund, just a voucher to stay in the future because we plan to visit Paris as soon as it is safe. They denied us ANYTHING and had ZERO customer service and again we asked for a voucher - not a refund. I understand they are a smaller hotel but expected WAY more from a 5-star property/ it was also for my birthday.

Property is clean, staff reasonable helpful and location is convenient.   However ... the breakfast is a  significant rip off unless it is included in your stay. We were charged 72 Euro for breakfast for two.    The pricing in the menu is confusing and part of the problem ... Example:    Omelette 12 Sausage 4 Tomato, spinach, cheese, mushrooms 3  What this means is that you will pay 24 for an omelette that includes 4 ingredients.  9 for coffee and tea ... downhill from there.   In addition, it is virtually impossible to control the water temperature for a shower. The water literally goes from freezing cold to scalding hot.   Avoid this hotel if you plan to take a shower or eat breakfast at the hotel."

I was impressed by the number of excellent reviews for this hotel. Sadly, I think the hotel is overrated and not great value for money.   I booked a premium room without a view which overlooked some air conditioning units covered with green plastic foliage, which was, to be honest, a little depressing, and I wished I'd paid extra for a view. The room itself was a decent size for Parisian hotels and well-designed and equipped. There was a good surface on which to work; a decent bathroom with bath and monsoon shower, full-length mirror, comfortable chairs, a large wardrobe with plenty of hangers and a large cupboard.

Exceeded our expectation on every count: * Airy meeting room with direct view to the church St Germain des Pres (see picture) * Nespresso machine and tea included in the package, with bottled water * Free internet with good connectivity * Most importantly - the lunch menu.  Tasty, hot French brasserie food served directly at negotiation table.  No small feat in locked down Paris where all restaurants and bars are closed!! * Extra bonus - the room service lady was so kind to bring us some free chocolates at request, when she takes the dishes back after lunch.  Hats off to hotel management.  All in, I paid around half what REGUS would have charged for a similar meeting room with NO view.   And"

We planned to stay for two nights but ended up staying over a week. The hotel is very comfortable with nice furnishings. They have a ton of outlets and even USB ports so there is never an issue of not having enough outlets. The best thing is the location which is steps away from the church and many many shops. During Covid, they can deliver breakfast to your room. The only confusing part is your bill at the end as ours was not itemized and we couldn’t figure it out easily as we kept extending nights. I emailed them later for a full explanation. I do need to double check our credit card for proper credits of the amounts we paid during our stay."

VIsited 9th - 12th of September.  The hotel is very well located next to Les halles station, with perfect metro connection and next to B line from airport.  We ordered Executive King room. We got room 208. It seems rooms 202, 204, 206... all have openable windows into the dining hall and not to the outside. This might be acceptable if Air conditioning A/C was working. It was not.  It was blowing in air but warm air only.  As the room was quite warm, weaking up sweating we talked to the front desk three times during different shifts. On all occations they were ""goin to look at it"" or ""send somone"".  In none of the occasion we received any feedback.   It became clear to me that the hotel was going to ignore this problem."

Every day of our stay he checked in on us, me and my two small children, and asked us if everything was well. Benjamin was so lovely and helpful, and that changed my mood from a bad one to a great one.

From the minute we walked in, the front desk staff were at-the-ready to make sure we had whatever we needed. It's really a tiny place, but for us that was the big plus ! Our room was absolutely wonderful with a great view of Rue Tronchet and it couldnt have been a better location for dining, shopping, or starting off on a day of sightseeing. Perfect."

I did a lot of research before choosing this property and I was not disappointed! The experience from start to finish was excellent! The room, while smaller than those found in North America, was large by European standards and was decorated in a very chic and modern style. The bathroom was large and the shower was excellent - great water pressure and temperature!! We had a lovely view of Rue Tronchet and the large windows open completely which gives the feel of having a balcony. The staff were friendly and helpful (especially as my French is weak to say the least!!) and the location was perfect - the Metro is on your door step, the shopping at Blvd Haussmann is a block away and the Louvre, Musee D'orsay,"

Many sights like the Louvre, Eiffel Tower and the Champs Elysees are a half hour walk away.   The rooms are a good size for Paris standards and the staff are friendly and competent.   The only negative: the breakfast room is very baldy lit, one can hardly see what one eats. I clearly suggest an improvement here to make the stay perfect."

Hope my review can help you to narrow down your selections.  In 2015, I stayed at Sofitel Le Faubourg and their rooms price raised a lot this July.  Since 8th arr. is where I familiar with so I decided to stay at Hotel Chavanel.   I booked a deluxe room for 4 nights from July 8th.  I really like this hotel for their excellent location, winthin 5 min to Franprix and within 10 min to Printemps, Lafayette and Monoprix.  The stuff was very friendly and helpful.  I felt sorry for travellers who experieced bad services. The buffet breakfast area was not big, they offered simple and yummy pastries, boiled eggs,"

We considered it a bit of a find, as it was in a good location for walking to a lot of the main sights, rather than using the Metro, which we found to be very crowded, even by London standards.  The room we had was very small, but fine for a few nights, and the toilet was not only separate from the bathroom, but in the opposite corner of the bedroom! The windows were well insulated and kept the traffic noise to a minimum. We had a first floor room and occasionally you could hear a rumbling, which I believe was probably the Metro passing below or nearby.  Breakfast was in a “cellar” room downstairs, but there was a fresh selection of food every morning.  It was clean and I would return for the location."

Firstly you need one that fits your budget and secondly, it needs to be centrally located to maximize the time you have in a destination.  Chavanel Hotel ticked all those boxes and more during our recent stay in the capital of France. Probably my favorite feature of this concept hotel is its elegant and yet chic decor. When we entered the hotel, we were impressed by birches in the lobby. These interior details made me miss my homeland. A white-trunk birch is considered to be one of the emblems of middle region forests of Russia. We stayed in a Deluxe room which is reasonably spacious for Paris.

We also asked if they could fix the safe, we had to ask three times before they said they could not fix it.

Our room was very spacious. The round bed was fun and confortable. The room was clean but the bathroom was not in great shape. The AC was not working properly. The hotel is not sound proofed and you can hear a lot of noise from the room. Staff was nice and check-in/out was quick. I will probably not go back.

We stayed in a superior room which is the black and white room, it's too small, has wall problems, not suitable for a couple with a baby. There is a balcony, very dirty and there were cigarette butts all over. The bathroom is OK, the toiletries aren't enough for two people, and I noticed some spots on an unused towel.  Breakfast was okay, nothing fancy."

They even decorated the bed with flower petals! Paloma was very helpful in getting us checked in and answered all of our questions.

Among the positive sides of our stay were fast check-in, room ready at noon, big room, big and comfortable bed. Location is great as well. However, the hotel was quite difficult to find, and we were not allowed to the swimming pool because our child is less than 16. This kind of information should be written jn hotel description, because swimming pool was my priority while searching for the hotel.  Also, we found blood stains on the blanket, and tobacco remainings on the lamp, so we guess that the room has not been properly cleaned after previous guests.

However, I am making an exception for this hotel.  Three of us, all adults, stayed in a triple room from November 26, 2019 - December 2, 2019.  The room, while a little tight, was fine for the three of us.  The hotel and our room was spotlessly clean and the staff, most of whom speak English, were gracious and helpful.  The beds and pillows were very comfortable.  We all slept very well.  The breakfast is good, particularly because it came with the room.  There was  much variety of food and coffee.    The location of this hotel is great.  Just two short blocks to the Cour St. Emillion metro station on a line that gets you anywhere you need to go in the City.  A block away is Bercy Village, a renovated area that used to be wine warehouses, and is"

We stayed 2 nights. It is extremely easy to get to from Gare Du Nord. Use train (Green) D then change in Chatelet to line 14 - dark purple, takes 30 minutes. The location is next to the Bercy Village complex which is a delightful shopping/eating village, really beautiful shops for presents to take home.  On arrival in the hotel we were greeted with a smile by a lovely Receptionist who even also spoke English. The room was a decent size for a city, small bathroom with a shower in it. Enough space for a couple on a citybreak. Tea and coffee making facilities were there/ also TV . Everything was very clean, 2 pillows to choose from: one Memory foam, one other one..

Room was little small though and shower cubicle space was quite restricted ...problem if bather is big size. Room was clean.

Hotel offer free storage space for luggages if arrive well before the checkin time. Nearby there are plenty of food choices ..we tried one Asian restaurant nearby and price was reasonable and food was nice.  There is also a rather big supermarket near to the hotel.

I took the RER B from CDG Airport and changed to Line 14 at Chatelet-Les Halles, all very smooth and fast. No fuss!!  For its location, I would say that the price is very reasonable. The staff were polite and not overly friendly (which is fine with me). The room and bed is very comfortable. Kettle is provided in the room, with tea, coffee, milk and biscuits. Soap is provided by the sink and in the shower, but no shampoo, conditioner or lotion (so, bring your own!).

The hotel is standard in every way, not pretentious at all, but offering basic service with not so basic prices. The room is rather small, but mine had a balcony overlooking the street, so it did not feel so cramped. I had a good sleep quality, mostly due to the memory foam pillows. There was not so much noise, so I slept rather well. Check-in and out was smooth, and staff did their job correctly (I mean, not going the extra mile in any sense of the word). It is a good 3 star hotel, with good service and placed in a great area, full of shops and restaurants and at the Metro Line 14, which is the best in my opinion, connecting with Paris really fast."

Accessibility:  Everything about this hotel is TINY.  From the small to non-existent lobby, to the small elevators, breakfast room, and especially the rooms.   It would be difficult if not impossible for anyone in a larger electric wheelchair or with a wide walker to maneuver in the elevator or breakfast room.   To be fair we did not stay in an accessible room.  However, the rooms we saw (when the maid was cleaning) and the one we stayed in was SO small that it was difficult to pull a suitcase between the end of the bed and the wall.  It was impossible for two people to walk past each other anywhere in the room.  And the bathroom was approximately 5 ft. by 6 ft.  The walk in shower is very small, about 3 ft. by 3 ft."

The hotel is 1 min away from Bercy village, where there are excellent restaurants. But I  think everyone should try the Japanese restaurant in front of the hotel. Also, the hotel is 3 mins walk away from the metro station; m14 which connects you to the m1 where you can go to all the major sites."

Accommodation is sort of central depending on your interests in Paris. The walls are VERY THIN! It's annoying trying to go to sleep with all the noise that was going on in the next room.

If there are 3 people sharing, even if it is a child, I would not recommend. If you’re heavy on luggage, I would not recommend.   The bathroom was tiny.

It served its purpose perfectly! Did not award 5 stars because my back is aching from the very hard bed :( but some may love that! Also the street noise from outdoors is significant even with windows closed. But otherwise a lovely stay in Paris in a wonderful hotel."

I cannot make any comment on the breakfast as we did not want to spend 10 euros each day so we bought things from the shop down the road! Although it did look nice and fresh!

Rooms are ok but not woow, then again you get what you pay for! Bathroom nice and clean the only negative point me and family noticed was the Carpet which was filthy not sure may be wasn’t cleaned before we checked in. Breakfast very basic for €12.50. If you don’t want to spend much on accommodation for short trip then this place would be ideal. Overall ok."

We didn’t opt in for the breakfast at the hotel as we ate at a French bakery located just around the corner where we could sit and people watch with a café latte and a pan au chocolate. The location of the hotel is a bit out of the way, we were close to a metro stop but we were not on one of the main lines meaning we always had to change trains to get to the main attractions and locations. This wasn’t too much of a problem as the metro runs early in the morning and late into the night. There is not much around"

The hotel was easily accessed from the Metro from our arrival point on the Eurostar, with only a short stroll from Bastille Metro stop.

The price did however seem quite reasonable, particularly when considering the cost of meals in Paris. It needs to be noted that the"

We thought the hotel was very nice. Yes, the rooms were a bit small, but we did not feel cramped at all. We had plenty of room for the little bit of time we spent in the room.  We were surprised how quiet the area was ( and we had a room facing Rue de Lyon). It was very close to the Bastille metro stop (from where you could get everywhere). After 8 days of riding the metro all over in Paris, we became very familiar with the system.  The room and bathroom were very clean, the bed and pillows comfortable. We had very restful nights after exploring Paris!  We did not get the breakfast , as we wanted to go out and explore options for breakfast, so I can not comment on"

It is perfectly located at walking distance from Bastille, subway, etc. and also very close to the train station Gare de Lyon. I walked there without problem.  The room with 2 twin beds was spacious, quiet thanks to good windows isolation (a little noise from people passing through the corridor though), with confortable bed, simple but nice decoration and good/crean/functional bathroom. The staff was very nice 24h.   Make sure to book directly from their website as the price is the same than other portals but, more importantly, they OFFER BREAKFAST if you book with their site. Worth it to save a few bucks for a good and complete breakfast (the croissants were to die for)."

We ate at Le Coq Rico in the Monmartre, A La Biche au Bois two blocks away, Au Temps des Cerises just on the Marais border, and les coquettes de Christian Constant close to Eiffel. All of these restaurants offer terrific food at reasonable prices. The room at Pavillon Bastille had a small cooler,and available coffee and tea.There is a large grocery about 1 1/2 blocks toward the train station.The entire hotel was clean and well taken care of.

We did not have breakfast as all hotels charge far too much so we went to a local cafe which was only five minutes away.

Not their fault how difficult it is to get Taxis at rush hours in Paris. Well situated clean and nice even though the rooms are small like they are so often in Paris. Simple but fine breakfast. My only negative comments is that they served cheese in small doses wrapped in plastic at breakfast. I would like to see the plastic disappear.

There were a few areas that have not been cleaned thoroughly enough.  The bathroom was spacious, but broken tiles, burnt light bulbs, and a filthy hair dryer couldn't be ignored.   The personnel were friendly and attended to requests, although on one occasion I was given the key to another room by accident.  There was dirt around the window frames and the AC ducts (although the AC was effective in cooling the room). Above issues aside, the location is excellent, and was the main reason why I did not check out earlier"

I used their taxi service last time to the airport was told it was a flat price but when I got there the driver insisted on quite a bit more and he dropped me far from the door in an unusual spot so he could avoid the traffic at the doors, i was uncomfortable and paid the higher price to get going."

Good ambience in the reception and bar area. Room was modern, clean and well decorated. There was a music festival on whilst we were there and we could not hear the noise (as the room was quite even though it faced a busy street). We felt that the hotel was well located and the standard high for the price paid. We would stay again."

FYI: Pictures on their website can be deceiving.  The staff was really friendly and very accommodating. The property looks sleek and modern in the lobby and in the rooms if you look from afar.  The room up close was another matter- I travel frequently in Europe and know rooms are small and that wasn't the issue.  This room looked like it hasn't been cleaned properly, the rug had white specks of dirt, the bathroom is in need of a good cleaning, some walls look like they had some water damage, bathroom was in need of some serious re-caulking and needed a paint job as the water and steam have affected some of the wood trim.  Plus it seemed grimy, by the looks of it they didn't"

Staff at the hotel were very helpful and their restaurant suggestions were very worth it.   My room looking out the window I can see Norte Dame.     The only thing difficult was the room key, which is a key fob. After about the second day you get used to it.  Breakfast was very good and worth it if you are out.

It was actually hard to change clothes in. In addition to the size, the paint was peeling off the walls. The bathroom was a disaster. Ceiling tiles and lights were coming down. The bathroom door wouldn’t stay closed. The sink was clogged. The shower head pointed to the wall and couldn’t be adjusted.  The staff didn’t seem to know what they were doing most of the time. Note that the front and only door to this hotel locks after hours. You have to be let in by reception. Twice we got back to the hotel and no one was there to let us in, so we had to wait outside until they got back.  Also note there is a major construction project right next to this hotel. According to friends that live near, it won’t be done anytime soon. They get started"

Both  Anais and Stephane. The friendliest person was the bartender Alexander. Our room was compact and very clean. The housekeeping staff did an excellent job. The best feature was that closeness  to the attraction we attended. Walking distance to the Metro subway. The Seine, The Louvre, and a nice hour walk to the Eiffel Tower."

We didn't have breakfast as at €10 per person we thought it quite steep for a croissant so went to the supermarket directly opposite and bought breakfast for four for €6!

Our stay was lovely, good location with loads of places to visit nearby and bus stop and tube station very close. We had an incredible value for the money but the best part of our stay was the staff. I made a last minute reservation and I was in contact with a very polite gentleman that reassured me that everything was ok before our flight to Paris (everyone speaks English and that really saved us since we do not speak French)"

Enough room for 2 people.

There is a small wardrobe with just a few hangers and no drawers, just a shelf, but that's fine for a few days. I don't take breakfast so I liked the fact that this was extra as I'm not paying for something I don't have. Apart from the shower problem, it was a really good stay and I would come back again.

If you desire perfection in a hotel, staff, services and amenities, this is it.   In 1996, I asked a well-traveled older gentleman where to stay in Ireland.  He mentioned a hotel.  I asked why he liked it and he said: “Simply because it is the best hotel in the world.”  Now, clearly he had not been to every hotel in the world.  My son and I stayed in this hotel when my son was  only 14. Upon arriving, having been welcomed by name, the keys to the car taken, our bags taken to the room, shown to our rooms and asked if we were hungry and wanted some food, which was shortly brought to our room, we were looking out the window. I explained to my son that the other hotel I considered was behind that tree in the field. My son quickly"

The unfortunate and inescapable reality of European travel is that security issues have become important considerations.    In this context, we have never seen a hotel staff as informed and prepared as the Le Bristol is to deal with such issues - adroitly working to guide and protect its guests during turbulent times. During our 2019 visit, the management of Le Bristol had extraordinarily accurate and timely information as to the critical security and logistical consequences of the protests and resultant police activity throughout the City.

The ambiance at the reception was welcoming, and I loved how lively the bar downstairs was. The food was amazing and had very competitive prices.

I really loved the size of the rooms and the free pocket wifi that the hotel provided, as well as the price point and location of the hotel. The drawbacks were that the room faintly smelled like cigarettes, it was a non-smoking room but I think that the walls were thin next to the building beside the hotel, or smoking from the street below wafted up. It was enough to make me feel sick a few times. Also, the hotel room was stifling hot at night, and we had to sleep with the windows open, which led to noise at all times of the night in our room. The hotel is located on a very busy street, which is great, but it is noisy until about 2 or 3 am most nights. One morning I woke up at about 6"

We arrived slightly early for check in and asked if they would hold our bags. Luckily our room was ready so they checked us in early which was fab! When we got to our room we were not disappointed. The room was light and had lots of space for the two of us. The bathroom was spotless- I’m very picky with bathrooms and I could not find one fault. You are even provided with a pot full of ear plugs, cotton buds and any little extra you may have forgotten to bring. There is even a shower puff provided! It’s the small touches that make a hotel feel welcoming. There was a Bluetooth speaker, an iPad, kettle and a mini fridge with a mini bar available. The staff were friendly and always offered us bottles of water for our days out. Our room was"

The location is about as good as it gets. It's a 5 minute walk from all the Metro and RER lines at Chatelet-Les Halles (which means you can take the RER B train from CDG, take exit 3 out of the station, and walk a few minutes to get to the hotel). The neighborhood that the hotel's in is lively and interesting, and it's just a short walk to some very nice shopping streets like Rue Montorgueil and Rue Rambuteau.   The staff was very welcoming and knowledgeable. I really appreciate that they were able to check us in and get us into our room, even though we arrived very early. That was a nice start to our stay. I thoroughly enjoyed the history lesson one of the men on the front desk gave"

The Georges Pompidou Center is 5 minutes away on foot; the Louvre is 12 minutes away;  the d'Orsay Museum is about 30 minutes away. The hotel is located within the pedestrian zone with many interesting shops, restaurants, and bars.

The room was lovely and well organized. The bathroom was spacious and the shower was very good. The beds were comfortable. I was on the 5th floor and the elevator was convenient. My only complaint is the noise... If you sleep with the windows closed noise will not be a problem. The windows are pretty soundproof.  I prefer to sleep with the windows open so noise was a problem for me. The area has lively bars and can be quite noisy - especially if there is a soccer match - well into the evening (midnight). On the whole, I was very happy with this hotel and would certainly return. It is a great value. I arrived via RER B from CDG - The trip was fast and easy."

The hotel is in a great location, being within walking distance of a wide range of locations/sights around Paris, and with excellent transport links (metro, bus). The room was bright, relatively spacious and quiet. Breakfast offered a good choice of cold and hot food (although the coffee was pretty forgettable!) and the free soft drinks are a welcome bonus. The staff are excellent - very accommodating and welcoming. This was our first stay here, and I'd happily stay again."

The location was very convenient to many locations including short walks to the Champs Elysees, Gare St. Lazare, and many metro stations.  The available snacks from 2pm onward was tremendous and super appreciated.  Rooms were clean.  Fantastic showers!  Only complaint is that the rooms were very small.  Got two rooms, one of which we upped to a deluxe and it was not a big size difference at all - with that said it is Paris, so rooms are never big at this price range.  As long as your eyes are open on rooms size, I would very much recommend."

Firstly, the staff is fantastic. They are always kind, gentle and ready to help no matter what. We have requested help so many times and they were always fabulous. The room was a surprise for the better, it looks much bigger live than on the website. Clean, with a view, very nice bad and a big screen to enjoy it. Also, is super well located and you can go by walking anywhere in the most prestigious area in Paris. In summary, we can not be more happy and satisfied with them. Thank you Fabio and Simone for all!

We spent two nights here and can't complain. The hotel is situated about a 3-5 minute walk away from ""Saint-Augustin""-Metro-station, there's lots of busses stopping around the hotel and yet it's quite quiet in the rooms. We had a room facing the church and hence the road and it was still quiet enough except for the ambulances/fire trucks which are obviously louder.   The bathroom in our room seemed to have been recently renovated, everything was modern, great water pressure, warm water throughout, everything was very clean. Spacious enough rooms for hotels in the city. Hooks to hang up your things, a safe, everything you'd need available. One downside: our door was bent - it locked, but light came through thorughout the night.   There's a free"

As mentioned in other posts, the staff are very nice and provided great restaurant recommendations as well as help with everything with from airport transportation to where to get a covid test.  The neighborhood is great with plenty of cafes, shopping, easy access to the metro and walking distance to many tourist sites.  Highly recommend the Hotel Signature."

They booked restaurants for us , advised on covid testing, provided a kettle and a corkscrew and were just generally lovely people! Our room (no 21) was delightful - two huge windows and a balcony with table and chairs ) overlooking the street out side the front of the hotel.

But here’s an example of how they go above and beyond… I had written before I arrived as my flight landed early in the morning and I wanted a place to leave my bags. They said they’d note my early arrival and see if my room could be ready for a complimentary early check in… when I arrived (at 10:30 am, my room was ready). The breakfast was pleasant. The front desk (usually staffed by the owner) was always willing to provide my great directions and advice. I feel that traveling to a different country can be intimidating but this hotel’s hospitality makes it so much easier."

I was so impressed at how eager they all were to go above and beyond and help with planning or transportation advice or dinner or sight-seeing suggestions.  The location is very central, and is probably one of the tidiest hotels that I have ever stayed in. So many little nice and thoughtful touches made our stay there absolutely unforgettable. There is a very nice breakfast that costs extra but it is well worth it. Also, there is a Metro station just a block away, but most sightseeing destinations are walking distance away.  I would stay"

There is a parking building about 7 minutes walk away.  (Prepay for parking through Parclick or similar and get a lower rate than advised to me by the hotel. You also get unlimited entries and exits for the duration of your booking). Staff were all excellent, spoke English fluently and couldn't have been more helpful.

We asked for late check out unaware there was a massive cost due to miscommunication between my bf and the receptionist, then we were charged €60 at check out.

The only blip for us was that we had to call reception to turn on the air-conditioning in our room as there was no controller in the room but we'll give them the benefit of the doubt as we were only there for one night and perhaps other rooms have controllers in them."

The hotel is very well located, close to the Italy square, with lots of restaurants and cafes in the area. The rooms are small but nice and very comfortable and we are not in París to stay in the room, so they are perfect.  The staff speaks English very well and they are always ready to help.  Perfect hotel for a weekend if you want to visit the city."

I was a little surprised to see how many more options were available downstairs, but weren't made available to us on the menu used to order to our room.

The lighting was amazing too - what looked like industrial lights fixed to the ceiling which you could move around on long arms.  Then there was the shower - glossy black tiles with LEDs embedded in them and a rain shower head the size of a small table! To die for.  The bed was large and very

Our room was chicly designed, spacious, and had a nice view over the cityscape below.   Most notable was the unfailing helpfulness and professionalism of each member of the hotel's staff.  They answered our requests immediately, and were particularly informative and reassuring about current Covid requirements in Paris.

The staff, both at the front desk and at the restaurant, are very friendly and it was a pleasure talking with them !

I’ll start by saying I’m very glad I chose this hotel and it is justifiably high on tripadvisor. Having been on a 3 week trip around France and in many larger luxury properties, this smaller boutique hotel was a welcome change and offers a much more personal refined service that is more difficult to achieve in larger establishments.  Check in was very warm and welcoming, I found Gonzalo very charming and authentic and he remained so very helpful and attentive throughout my stay, regularly checking up on me.

Breakfast is absolutely  outstanding with a very wide choice to keep even the fussy eater happy.  The hotel has an honesty bar stocked with many drinks.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again,"

We have been visiting the Marais for about 20 years and the location can't be beat.  We opted for a larger suit this time and were not disappointed.  The staff is very helpful and made all our dinner reservations.  During the strike they kept us updated on all transportation issues.  Just made reservations for our next visit.

The Hotel decor is elegant and refined without being stuffy. The patio, lobby and dining areas are welcoming and intimate. There is a open, honor bar off the lobby stocked with quality wine, champagne and spirits for a drink with friends all afternoon and evening.   My room was truly memorable, which is saying a lot given how much I travel.  It was beautifully decorated with open beam ceilings and deep set character windows overlooking the streets below.  It had a comfortable and lovely living room area, well appointed bath, and large bedroom with period antique furniture.    The staff at the front desk was very helpful and friendly.   My only criticism is that the support staff could be better trained."

For this trip, however, we decided to check out Le Marais, the very hip and colorful district straddling the 3rd and 4th arrondissements. A savvy traveler friend directed us to the five-star hotel Le Pavillon de la Reine, located on the Place des Vosges, in the center of it all.  This regal stone and brick structure beckoned visitors through a narrow passageway leading into a lovely courtyard with umbrellaed tables surrounded by greenery fronting the hotel’s main entrance. Given the season, it was festively lit prompting many passersby to sate their Instagram addictions. The lobby and common"

Enter through a traditional Paris gate/door into a magical courtyard. Wonderful staff. Beautiful, comfortable, quiet sitting room in the entrance.  There is a spa but we didn’t visit.  We stayed in one of the cheaper rooms so it was small and beside the elevator but it was still very comfortable and the bathroom was very nice. Clean.  Welcome chocolate too!  I just can’t give 5 stars for a place that costs this much!  Other than price - no complaints."

The staff were very friendly and helpful, the reception area is very clean, modern and stylish, and the room was very comfortable!   We were lucky and were given an upgrade to a delux room for our stay.  Whilst the rooms are small (as to be expected in Paris) they are beautifully decorated and in immaculate condition. It had everything we needed, as well as a tv hidden in the mirror which was very cool!  We had to preorder breakfast due to COVID 19 which was brought to our room, which personally I loved as it was like have fresh continental breakfast in bed!

We had an early flight in and were able to check into our room early, around 11:00am which was a great surprise. Our room was very comfortable and the hotel itself was clean, great location, and quiet.   We were meant to leave the next morning to get our flight back to the U.S., but my husband became ill with what we now think was extreme stomach poisoning (we did not eat at the hotel). He was sick enough that we couldn't get on our flight and instead had to go to the ER to make sure he was okay. I wish I had gotten the employee's name who helped us call a cab, talked to the cab drive in French and told him exactly where to go and was just so compassionate. When we returned, the same employee was there"

The hotel is situated in an ideal location for sightseeing activities around Paris, it is near the Metro and taxis abound day and night.

I'd say that the rooms are above standard for most hotels in this range (I've tried at least 5 so far this year). I'm in a smaller room this time, trying a superior room in a couple of weeks. Anyway, it's clean, well decorated, very modern, and the bathroom is quite nice (except for the fact it has a tub and not a shower - why? why would you do that in 2020...) I haven't had breakfast but the dining room looks very nice. I'll try tomorrow for some drinks. Reception was very good, the gentleman when I arrived was charming and efficient. So why not 5 stars?

We were traveling with 2 kids ages 7 and 9 and booked the family suite, which is basically 2 quasi connected rooms. You have a private hallway with locking door that connects to two rooms that aren't actually connected. Worked perfect.   Don't let the pictures fool you, the rooms are tiny, but very much so adequate especially if traveling light. The rooms are super clean and comfortable and come with everything you need.   The metro is down the street (less than 5 mins walk) and there are plenty of restaurants nearby. Pizza place 4-5 doors down (good for  the kids after a long day of traveling.)   Overall solid place to stay at a pretty reasonable price. Highly recommend."

The day staff was very helpful with luggage- we pulled up around the corner because Rue de Archives is pretty narrow and we had a lot to unpack. I was so thankful for the help carrying everything in and up to the room.

Our room felt private, was spacious, elegant and comfortable. The website coyly suggests the romantic possibilities of the rooms, and we could see their point.

On the day of our checkout, the housekeeping staff knocked and entered the room 5 times successively, starting at 9am, all the way until 12:30pm. Very short-term memory. This goes against hotel standards whereby HSK is informed of the room vacancy by the front office, once the guest has checked out.

So if you have an early train departure or flight from CDG (via RER B), this hotel would be a logical choice. However, it doesn't have as many fun common spaces for the guests to simply hang out. While the hotel does feature a requisite Neni restaurant that serves sumptuous breakfasts and great dinners, and an adjacent plush hipster bar, it offers few additional amenities, such as lounges with comfortable sofas, or mini libraries for the guests to browse. But then again, you are, after all, in the middle of Paris, and the Metro is literally at your front door. It may be wrong to be wasting your time in a hotel, no matter how"

Location in front of Gare du Nord is a bit rough and loud, but this is not influencing my review because it‘s not the „fault“ of the hotel and it is convenient when you travel with e.g. the Thalys train. The house in which the hotel is located is very beautiful!   Corona rules make sense and are easy to adapt, except that you can not leave your luggage there, that does not make sense and you could organise this without contact to the customer/luggage. I assume it’s a manpower saving measurement.  But why is service at breakfast that slow and understaffed, even if the house was not full? That makes no sense and is annoying. The employees are really very nice and helpful and that‘s also not nice for them, because customers get"

The room was quite small although classed as a medium. The bed was comfortable and warm. There was little space to walk passed the bottom of the bed due to a shelf. The tv on the wall was enclosed in doors which did not fold completely back to the wall. I felt this was a hazard and did I fact bang my shoulder walking passed. The bathroom was nice and had a separate toilet. Due to restrictions regarding COVID 19 no room cleaning was available fully understandable, they did supply fresh towels on request and did in fact remake our bed twice. The only issue I have regards this arrangement was that they did not supply the room with any products for cleaning the toilet.  The breakfast was disjointed and a bit disorganised."

The room was spacious enough but there was very little space to hang clothes. We could not hang 2 adult and 2 children’s winter coats.   The hotel is fairly central to lots of cafes, bars, shops and bakery’s.   The hotel is a good 20 - 30 min walk from several metros stops enabling you to travel around Paris fairly easily. It was tricky with cases and tired children. We are seasoned travelers too.   You can see the Effiel Tower from the end of the street and from the 8th floor of the hotel.  It is also an easy 20 - 40 min walk to the tower from the hotel.   If returning to Paris we would not choose it again as it was not close enough to the metro stations."

The room does not have a single unnecessary square centimeter, and few frills. But it was perfect for a good night sleep.

Short walk to the Pasteur Metro and right next to gare montparnasse. Suggest to get a room in the front to avoid noise in the rear.  Highly recommend local restaurant Café templier a few steps away, best kept secret in Montparnasse."

All the staff were kind and attentive, and the breakfast is a feast! The hotel is about a 30-minute walk to the Eiffel Tower. And there are many restaurants, cafes, shops, etc. surrounding it. The hotel is very clean and contemporary. Our only issue was that our TV wouldn't allow for English subtitles. But since we watched very little TV while there, we didn't complain."

Right off the bat, our rooms weren’t ready on time so we left our luggage at the hotel and came back later.  The check-in process feels a bit disorganized with the check-in desk being two high tops near the entrance.    The other thing is that the hotel caters to families with kids and I wish we had known that before booking.  We couldn’t really have a relaxing drink at the bar since kids were running around shouting throughout the stay.  If you are looking for a relaxing place to stay on your trip to Paris, look elsewhere."

It looks tired although in a very good location central to main attractions of Paris. Very friendly staff whom where helpful. Bedrooms clean and tidy although seemed to be very warm even with the heating off. Would recommend as a cheap base just really used for sleeping.  I’m sure once the hotel has finished being renovated it will be of a much better standard  If your looking for somewhere basic and clean in a good location this is the hotel for you. No frills classic 3 star we would say.

The location of this hotel is not bad.  Accessible to transportation-bus stops and metro stops (although public transportation is on strike at this moment which I believe is over a month now.)  Either you walk or take the Uber.  Distance to Central Paris is not bad.  About 15 to 20 minutes by Uber to go to Eiffel Tower.  Give some time to get to places.    The food selection at the restaurant is good too.  The breakfast buffet has a good selection of food to choose from.    Hotel rooms and bathrooms are very clean and you could hardly hear noise of your neighbor.  Staff are very nice and helpful.  Surrounding areas has plenty of restaurants to choose from.  Maybe about 3 blocks or a

When closed it cancels out nearly all the noise, which is nice..  I love it when a compact room has everything in the right place and this one hits all the marks. More than enough closset space for two plus equiped with a 16” safe and a built in mini fridge @ foodies I’m a big lad but we had no trouble fitting in the tub/shower..

Location is great for getting around Paris and rooms are spacious by Paris standards.  Rooms and property seemed generally clean and safe with attention to heightened health standards.

I was dealing with a women named Magdalena.  She does NOT reply to email and IGNORES all travel agent requests  I was supposed to be a client there on the 17th of July - 20th of July 2020 and due to the global pandemic and current travel ban was unable to attend.   All hotels in Europe had NO ISSUE in offering a refund - BUT PARIS.  MAGDALENA ignores all emails which is rather frustrating when you are an international traveller.   I have informed the hotel of the current ACCC policy but they refuse to give my money back.

The guy at the front desk was very helpful, he arranged an airport transfer for us for the next day.  The hotel is super close to the Eiffel Tour and lots of good restaurants and coffee shops.  The room was spacious and very clean. The mattress was super comforable.

Henry, the front desk clerk, was charming and kind, making check in stress free especially after our taxi driver attempted to scam us on way from train station (YIKES!!).

Overall, I was happy with the room, it was well priced, centrally located within a short stroll to the Eiffel Tower and we had a decent sized room compared to some tiny Paris hotels I have stayed in previously. The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean, the bathroom in particular was very generously sized. We had a good night’s sleep and were not disturbed by any external noise at all.  All staff that we interacted with were lovely and the included breakfast was very good and plentiful. My one criticism is that the smell of cigarette smoke in the room was very, very strong, as soon as we opened the door it hit us, we had to air the room out and spray perfume to try to mask the smell.

Loud, cheap materials, moldy shower was some of the issues we were dissapointed about.   We first got assigned a room on 3rd floor windows facing the street. With closed windows we were disturbed with the trafic noise, some singing concert across the street and people chattering on the street.

The room was not super well designed. For a hotel that used a “work and Pley” option as part of their marketing - the “desk” in the room doubled as a nightstand with a stool as a chair and the Wi-Fi was shotty. There was a coworking / restaurant space on the lobby floor but for me me could have used a bit more designation - I didn’t use it. The rooms also did not have an additional security lock which as a woman, is not ideal. Also re: security - the elevators do not require keys to go up so in theory someone could just walk in and go up. The bathrooms…..the tub was high and as a shorter person you have to really mindfully step out of the tub. The glass screen had little mobility which meant"

The location is great and the breakfast is perfect.  My main issue was with the bed it was two singles pushed together and very uncomfortable mattress. My main concern was the very strong horrible smell in the room it was actually overwhelming when you entered the room and upon talking to other guests it was other rooms than ours also. Overall it’s a budget hotel with a great location it’s handy if you won’t be in the room all the time but it’s not a comfortable lounging room.

The hotel is very close top Gare de Lyon, which makes it also very close to the Paris Islands, Bastille, Louvre, Les Halles, etc. Although near the road and the railway station, the rooms are isolated so you won't hear traffic and other noises. Rooms are small but comfortable with everything you need. Breakfeast was very sufficient to start your day."

The hotel is literally across the street from the station and surrounded by restaurants featuring different cuisine.  Friendly staff and importantly, they provide spare pillows.

And it was really disappointing. Of all our 20 years old travel stories, this was the worst hotel and most terrible staff. That is why I am writing this review. This is the first time I experienced so much bad customer service. The staff was really unfriendly and behaved creepily. The hotel is really small and the rooms even smaller and really cold. So after checking out, we left a couple of bags in the hotel’s luggage compartment. When we returned to the hotel to pick up the bags the man at the reception shouted at us to disappear immediately because of the covid. I went to the bathroom for about 5 mins, fillowed by my daughter went to the bathroom for the same time. I told the man from the staff that when my daughter comes out of"

Was a nice, clean, comfortable hotel. We were surprised by the (for Paris) spacious room with a king size bed. The toilet, on the other hand, was a bit small, my knees knocked against the door. The bathroom was nice with a big shower. Breakfast was served in the room due to Covid, was a decent breakfast. Location was excellent if you need to use public transport, across from Gare de Lyon in a side street. Super for catching the metro!  Only negatives: the airconditioning didn't work the 2nd night (but it wasn't too bad) and we woke up a few times due to people out on the street shouting in the middle of the night (we had a room on the street side) but the hotel can't do much about that.

I am moving to Montpellier and hoped to find regular hotel in Paris, near to the train. There are plusses, but nothing makes up for the owner and staff. Minuses: The room (a single) was small, even by Paris standards With no luggage stand, the suitcase lived on the floor and had to be constantly kicked aside. The shower was SO small that you shouldn't take this room is you are at all hefty. I am 5'3""/106#. When I twice dropped the soap I seriously hit my head on the sharp door handle on the way up. Tip: step outside the shower, retrieve the soap and step back in. Lots of noise through the thin walls, even with their normal activity. Bring earplugs for that. My other gripe was the way they handled the lobby renovation."

This is NOT a luxury hotel.  Under renovation for quite some time it is coming along.  The lobby floor is incomplete but not unpleasant. The staff was very courteous and helpful. Rooms are small but very clean. An easy walk to the Bastille and across the street from the train station.  At the opposite end of the street we discovered Le Duc De Richelieu. It is a charming restaurant with personal & friendly service, nice wine and good food. Loved it!"

The front desk staff are always helpful, polite and responsive and the staff that clean the rooms are very good at what they do.  The breakfast is excellent too. Lovely bread, good coffee, scrambled egg, bacon, croissants and more. For me, the only thing are that are missing is some kind of fruit salad (although there is fresh fruit available) and ketchup (but I really do feel ashamed to type that!!).

To ask for any assistance from staff seemed like they had to cut off a leg for you, too much effort for them to even look you in the eye or give you more than 4 words in a sentence.

We were absolutely satisfied with this hotel! First of all, this is a great location if this is the area you want to be in (near the Eiffel Tower). It is a lovely Boutique Hotel with the small elevator & winding steps up to the  Reception area. We had a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower which was amazing! I could lay in bed and watch the Eiffel tower sparkle at night! Sure the room is not that big but those who complain must not travel in Europe often because rooms are not that big. The shower was simply wonderful because of the overhead rain showerhead. Plus we even had a view of the Eiffel Tower from our bathroom! So we loved our room on the 6th floor.  Secondly, the service at the front desk was fabulous,"

The room was clean and the bathroom had a rain shower! The staff were all very friendly and helpful with answering any questions we had during our stay.

But other than that, we weren't so impressed.  We stayed in another hotel in Paris near the train station (Whistler) and it was a better hotel (not counting the location).  You can't beat the location on Rue Cler with lots of restaurants/shops just meters away and walkability to the Eiffel Tower.  There's a supermarket nearby, and the metro stop is not far either.    As for the bad: tiny room with not much in the way of furniture besides the bed.  Hard to find a place to put things.  Tiny claustrophobic elevator and narrow stairs.  No freebies, they have drinks/snacks available in the kitchen but they are all overpriced.  One day they forgot (?) to restock our room with anything, we didn't have"

I want to thank all the staff, especially Florentin, who helped us secure transportation during the strikes this past December.   The view from our room of the Eiffel Tower was memorable plus.   The restaurants, the market and shops like the chocolate one on the street made it a great place to stay.   It’s about 10 mins walk from the Eiffel Tower.   Rooms are small, bathroom was still decent size.   The elevator fits two people only or one person with their bag."

A charming boutique typically Parisian hotel right in the heart of it all. I have travelled with my daughter who is in an electric wheelchair and we had equiptment delivered to the hotel. I knew this was a typical Parisian hotel, that's what I wanted.  Via phone calls and emails, Victor and Suzan who were were so efficient, they arranged everything perfectly, even a taxi to collect us.  Customer service at its finest. We even had a room with a balcony that looked onto the Eiffel tower. So beautiful to wake up to and watch lit up and sparkling on in the evening. 15 mins walk away to the Tower and the Arc de triomphe. Perfect destination.

The location of his hotel is amazing. It is walking distance to the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de triomphe and is located next to amazing hotels and restaurants. There is also a convenient bus stop down the road. The hotel breakfast is not free at the time of our stay but was amazing.

I understand that hotel rooms in Europe are small, however this was beyond small. We could not believe how small this room and the bathroom was.  The window opened up to a dark tunnel of ugly concrete walls of other buildings. We had just checked in after a long flight from the USA and were in the room about 20 minutes when a staff member just walked right in on us.  No knock at the door, nothing.  When I asked why, she said she was just checking in on us. Weird. We could not get the safe to work and all of the staff that we came across at the front desk were rude and unhelpful as far as recommendations or directions go. Without a doubt, we would not stay here again."

Location is good for the Eiffel Tower and Arc De Triomphe.

The room was quite hot at times but we opened the window and this was fine. Staff were friendly! Couldn’t fault the room.

We have both done a fair amount of international travel, so we are familiar and totally fine with smaller hotel rooms from time to time. That being said, this room was very small (bathroom as well). The location is good as you can walk to many locations you would want to see in Paris and walking out of the hotel to see the Eiffel Tower is definitely a plus.   That being said, the red flag for us was coming back to a room door that was left open by the cleaning crew. The room door must have not shut all the way as they left the room (innocent mistake), however obviously many of our belongings were in the room all day and this could’ve been a bad situation for us. When we brought this to the attention of hotel staff, the"

The pictures attached to my review should speak volumes for what I found when staying at the Warwick.

Rooms were nice and we had a nice view on the Parisian style buildings on the other side of the street.   from the hotel you can easily walk to the Le Marais neighbourhood and Canal St. Martin which are both very nice areas.   Breakfast was not very special and it took a long time before we got served. But I guess this is due to Corona and that in normal times there is a buffet where you can help yourself.  I did not use the spa so cannot comment on that.  Will be back!

The hotel frontage is very small - so is the rest of it - tall and narrow, built around a small courtyard. Rooms are small but well equipped, and the breakfast buffet is - by French standards at least - quite reasonable (scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage). Very helpful staff at Reception."

Within easy walking distance from Gare du Nord we found the hotel in a back street location which left a bit to be desired. The frontage looks a little run down which concerned me, but as soon as you walk through the front door, you’re in a clean, well presented reception area with an extremely well presented, polite, efficient, humorous, English speaking receptionist. I understand that not all reception staff speak as good English as the young man we encountered. All the staff we encountered were exceptionally polite and couldn’t do enough to make our stay enjoyable. In fact, I’d go as far to say that they were more than happy to go out of their way for their guests. Our room, (307) was"

Bathroom and shower (not walk-in) was sizeable. The staff, all of them are excellent, nothing is too much. The two restaurant recommendations nearby were both superb.  You are located around 10 mins (slow walk) from Gare du Nord, so perfect for Eurostar or airport (with RER connection). There is a food market less than a minute's walk away.  The breakfast is wide ranging, lots of choice, don't think they have evening restaurant option but they will put out a lovely meats / cheese / salmon platter on request, delicious! After a good days sight seeing, their small bar area is a cosy place to have a couple of drinks before retiring for the evening. They advertise a spa but we did not use, so"

We are so glad we did. The staff was beyond accommodating. Typically, I get names and I neglected to do so. Every interaction we had with staff was really pleasant/entertaining.   We checked in the morning of 1/1/2020. Our room wasn't ready and the front desk person offered to store our luggage until our room was ready. Within minutes, he found us a room, without our asking, which was an upgrade, at no additional charge.

Very competitive rates and good value for money. The desk clerks are very friendly, welcoming and attentive. Location is great and though basic, the room/bathroom was spacious, clean and comfortable. Rue Darcet is more quiet than the surrounding streets and the hotel's windows are quite thick, so except for what I think was a garbage collection truck at one point (weird since it was a Sunday morning, so maybe it was something else) it was very quiet despite facing the street  -- though perhaps I will request an ""inside"" room next time. Definitely recommend."

When I was walking up the stairs, I saw the 4 cleaning staff tackling the daily clean, including *wiping down the outside of the guest doors.*  At what hotel have you ever seen this done??  I was really impressed.  I would have preferred it if I didn't have to leave my key at the front desk whenever I departed; as a person traveling alone that made me uncomfortable.  However, the desk does stay open 24"

Everything went well for us. A special mention to the staff. Both the blokes we dealt with were great with a special mention to ol mate (didn’t catch name) who was working the nights for being super helpful and just a good bloke. He’s worked there for 18years! He even tolerated a late night hug from my over enthusiastic drunken fiancé haha

The Blue Suite on the 6th floor was large enough for all 4 of us to relax in when we were not out exploring the city.  We did note that the furniture and carpet are not as shown in the photo on the website, but were a bit less smart.  Had a lovely soak in the bath and enjoyed the multi-jet shower.

One colleague has a leaking shower constantly dripping and making noise, the hotels solution... Bring up a plastic bucket to catch the water.  Next, no irons in the room, requested over the intranet, no answer, go downstairs to politely ask for one the answer ""non, tomorrow"" explain that i just need an iron for my clothes for work tomorrow ""non, tomorrow."" aparently it's my fault for not checking in before they had given out their only three irons in the hotel.

However, upon arrival, the room given to us was very different from what we expected. It seemed like a room from de 80s, furniture old, the bathroom also... When taking a shower, the water inevitably came out and the bathroom floor was flooded. Because of this we asked for another room. Ali at reception was very helpful and helped us move to another room which was much better and that had been renovated. Breakfast was very good. All staff members were kind. Location is very good.

It certainly lived up to this as it was only a short walk away. It was also a short walk to the Arc de Triomphe.   The hotel itself is lovely. The reception staff were really helpful and nothing felt like too much trouble. I arrived early having had a particularly stressful journey on the Thello sleeper train and they couldn’t have been more accommodating. They arranged an early check in and provided coffee and pastries while I waited. My luggage was put in my room ready.   The room itself was simply perfect. I felt instantly relaxed. The bed was so comfortable and the bedding felt luxurious. The toiletries were all L’Occitane and smelt divine. There was a dressing gown hung on the door which was a lovely touch.

A lot of dodgy taxi drivers at the station.  The location of this hotel is off the scale amazing just perfect in every way close to all the sights if you don’t fancy walking,the bus is better choice than metro and cheaper. This hotel is small but lovely, clean comfortable and homely. The breakfast was delicious people would probably want more selection, however my family thought it’s just right and healthy.

There is a shower and tub with toilet in a seperate area.  The only drawback for us was that the stairs by the room and starting about 7am you can hear people coming down.

Cons: rude staff, minimal amenities, bad breakfast, no effort to make you feel welcomed or like a guest. Pros: decent room and bathroom size, location two blocks from the metro.

The construction noise from the neighbors? No excuses or apologies. Tough time here. But we didn’t let it ruin an otherwise delightful trip. Just go somewhere else."

The shower area was also very small. The common area and the dinning area were large and spacious.   The breakfast buffet was filled with variety of delicious breads and pastry options. They bake most of the food fresh in the hotel itself. So you could smell the auroma of the food by 7 am. The best part of the hotel stay. Even on the day of our departure we were able to have the

The location, facilities and staff were all good.   The  good things of location are as follows. ・ 15-minute walk from Opera Garnier ・ 15-minute walk from Paris North Station ・ One minute walk to supermarket (Carrefour City) ・ 3-minute walk to some shops where we can buy side dishes (Cade Street)  The  good things of facilities are: ・ Sufficient space ・ Proper water pressure ・ Clean room and bathroom  There were points such as ""no chain on the door"", ""no provision of drinking water"", ""no refrigerator in the room (it is in the common space)"", and ""no security box in the box"".  However, these light shortcomings are eliminated by the greatness of the above advantages and the great staffs described below.  I had booked"

The Paris hotel Touring Opera Hotel was a diamond in the ruff. It should be rated much higher than it is. 4.0 - 4.5, out of 5 stars. The owners, Gil and his wife were more accommodating than most inn keepers in big name places. Clean, quiet, decorative, safe and warm. They made customers feel at home and always their priority. Paul, on the front desk, was a gentleman of endless information. Breakfast was amazing and Bon Appétit. Large variety and all homemade. The owners are hands-on with their location and their customers needs and wants. When we return, we will definitly stay there. Wait until you receive your room key. !!!! Loved the property. Central location is close to everything you need or want."

The hotel is located on a quiet street in the 9th arrondissement, a beautiful area with fabulous Haussman architecture.  The hotel room was small by American standards but clean and comfortable, nice hot shower.  The room does not have a/c which might be an issue in Summer but was no issue during my stay.  There was a typical buffet breakfast daily which included delicious freshly baked breads and croissants. Most importantly the hotel is well situated with lots of restaurants, supermarkets and cafes close by.  The Metro station Cadet on the 7 line is about 3-4 minutes walk from the hotel.  That metro line can be used to connect directly or by transfer to most attractions. There are city buses close by"

Location wise this hotel was perfect and had loads of bars and shops within walking distance.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  Our room was stunning and had a lovely patio area with chairs to sit and relax in (although in Feb it was too cold!) but in the summer I imagine it would be perfect (room 57)  The only downside to our stay, was that there wasn't any tea/coffee making facilities and there wasn't much storage.  I would definitely recommend this place."

The rooms are quite tiny and there isn’t much, if any, closet space, but it wonderfully located and a beautiful spot. If you’re looking for a grand hotel, this isn’t for you, but if you are looking for a nice little room to relax in when you’re not walking the city, I highly recommend this hotel. I don't think it would be large enough for two people, but for one it is enough room. The staff was very helpful and kind and it’s minutes from wonderful shops and cafes. I will definitely come back. My personal favorite was the small terrace, where I took my coffee in the morning."

It is in the 4th arrondisement and within walking distance of lots of shops, bars and restaurants and right next door to the Reaumur Sebastopol metro stop on line 4. This is just one stop from Chatelet les Halles and the RER line B which is a direct regional train to CDG airport. The hotel itself overlooks a small square and is on a side street/square just off two main roads, which means there wasn't as much traffic noise plus excellent blackout curtains mean that it was easy to sleep. All the staff we encountered were polite, friendly and keen to help and please. The rooms themselves are small but contain everything you'd need and were very clean.Top floor (up to floor 8) rooms have the best views as do"

I cant imagine the unfortunate people who have gotten smaller rooms as I'm sure their experience is worse.   1) The noise. You can hear absolutely everything. My neighbors upstairs stay up until 1 or 2 every night and you can hear all the footsteps and heavy creaks with the old wood. It sounds like a walrus moving furniture.

What a nice surprise to discover The Little Palace Hotel. The location is convenient for walking or riding the Metro.  We had a lovely room on the top floor overlooking the park. Very comfortable and clean. Bathroom wasn't large but that is what is expected in European hotels. The front desk was very pleasant and helpful with directions.

I missed having a little coffee and/or tea station in the room though, as it would have been nice to enjoy a morning coffee in the room without having to go to the reception to buy one. Also a flat iron would have been nice. The breakfast was not worth the 15 euros, but we just went elsewhere to get breakfast. Neighborhood is fantastic with a metro right next to the hotel!

This was our first stay in Paris and the hotel seemed to be a good option considering the price per night for the location.   The staff are extremely friendly, whether it be the reception/concierge (who speak a variety of languages) or the caterers/cleaners. For instance, they helped with directions and recommendations for restaurants etc.  However, upon arrival when we checked in and went up to our room, we unexpectedly opened the door to one of the hotel's handymen who was just as surprised as us. Reception had evidently failed to notify either of us, so we had to wait outside our room for 10 mins or so whilst he finished. Initially, this did not bother us too"

The rest of the staff are great as well, including the lovely ladies from housekeeping who wait downstairs, with a smile, as you remove the do not disturb tag and head outdoors.

Since there is a direct train from Austerlitz station for Paris to Orleans, I decided to stay at this hotel.   The hotel is nice and is a 5 minute walk away from Austerlitz Station. The hotel room was on the 5th floor both the times. The staff was quite friendly. There are very good eateries nearby and a Jardin Des Plantes garden next to it. If I travel to Paris again or if I have to visit Orleans again, I would probably stay at this hotel again."

Upon arrival to the hotel, there was some confusion over payment. The receptionist was rude and impatient, and gave the impression she was not interested in what I had to say.  After this, we entered the hotel room, which was not clean and had dirty cups under the bed. As well as general dirt (especially in the bathroom). We soon realised when using the shower, that water would leak out onto the floor. Completely flooding the room. I went to report this to management and was told they couldn't do anything about it at that time (no reason given. it was 3pm)   The electricity went off one afternoon, I went to speak to the receptionist who said they didn't know what had happened, and didn't have an estimated time it"

However, once you enter, you are greeted by a clean modern interior, compared to the old facade of the street.  The room we stayed in was tiny by our standards however this is the only hotel we have stayed at in Paris so this may be normal. The Metro and commuter rail stations are very close.  Definitely check with the hotel if you are not able bodied as things are cramped and the elevators seem to only go to half levels which means you have to use at least one flight of stairs. Our only issues were the tiny shower which did not seal properly so a fair bit of the water we used ended up on the floor. The walls are very thin so if your neighbours make a"

The air conditioning didn't work properly, neither the extractor fan in the bathroom. We could clearly hear voices from adjacent rooms until late in the night.

Yes, the rooms are small - it's Paris. The bathroom had a full size bath with a shower over which had plenty of hot water and decent pressure.

The location is the best part of staying at this hotel.  It is literally steps away from the Pernety Metro station and has many cafes, fruit shops, restaurants and supermarkets as well as a self-service coin laundry down the road.  You really do feel immersed in the Parisian culture here as it's out of the ""touristy"" part of town.

The room I was given was really really small, but for a place to sleep for 1 (ONE) person was enough. Not appropriate for more than one person, as you can observe in the pictures. Everything was very clean. The bathroom was small (again, sorry for repeating myself), but comfortable and clean.

I also put the ""do not disturb"" sign outside the door and the cleaners still knocked on the door very loudly while I was trying to sleep mid-morning.

I couldn’t go to the hospital in France because my flight was leaving in two hours and our taxi was outside. I had no choice but to fly back to Miami with a broken ankle.

Breakfast was basic as well with bread, beverage, a fruit and yogurt and cereal. There’s no other amenities in the hotel but its nicely situated close to the metro and bus stops.

The room i got was pretty basics, included a regular bathroom with toiletries. Theres no common are in the hotel except the reception area so they serve the breakfast in your room. Breakfast was basic as well with bread, beverage, a fruit and yogurt and cereal. There’s no other amenities in the hotel but its nicely situated close to the metro and bus stops. I guess the price of the hotel is mostly based on that reason. Didn’t stand out at anyway. Would’ve probably pick another hotel if not for the credit."

The location was a few minutes walk to the Louvre, the Metro and many restaurants. The staff were so helpful from the time we checked in to our request for a taxi at 3 am to get to the airport going home. We actually stayed in two separate rooms because our original booking through my company website was for a single. Although the hotel was fully booked, the lovely woman working the desk put us in a room beside the church (beautiful view) the first night and then moved all our luggage (including our champagne in the refrigerator) to a larger room next door for the second night. The rooms were beautifully furnished, roomy enough, the beds soft and comfortable, and the TVs nice and large! I would stay here again and would highly recommend this"

We thought the room would give us a comfortable stay until we pulled back our sheets... to our disgust a set of fake eyelashes were stuck to the inside of the quilt cover. This was not okay and when staff were notified they delivered new sheets to the room for us to remake the beds ourselves.   This was not okay and makes us believe that our room was not cleaned prior to arrival.

However, the staff are completely disinterested in providing anything other than an absolutely perfunctory service. We encountered three different employees during our weekend visit and they all exhibited the same level of engagement and customer service: poor. We couldn’t even get two extra tea bags at 10pm. It’s not that the staff were rude, just that they gave the impression they didn’t want to be there."

It was big, particularly by Parisien standards. Largely done up in black & white, there were colourful drapes & cushions adding a welcome contrast to the look & ambience. The bathroom was comfortably sized as well, & had both, a tub & a shower. Air conditioning, useful on warm Paris nights, worked well. The hotel is strategically located in a tourist friendly area, just minutes from the Opera House & the large department stores on Boulevard Haussmann. 2 metro stations - Cadet & Grands Boulevards - are located very close to the hotel, & would likely take you to almost any place in Paris that a tourist would expect to go to. The area around the hotel is replete with cafes, restaurants & eclectic shops & boutiques. But being situated in a quiet"

The location of this hotel is possibly the best you could wish for in Paris with Les Halles and Étienne Marcel metro stations within 3-5 minutes walk and the RER from CDG airport stopping in Les Halles. The room is very well appointed with tea & coffee making facilities, a fully stocked mini bar, safe and wardrobe, well sized en-suite and television. The hotel has a lift and restaurant, although we did not use the restaurant ourselves. The room, and hotel in general, is very clean and well presented and the staff are friendly and very helpful.

I really loved the size of the rooms and the free pocket wifi that the hotel provided, as well as the price point and location of the hotel. The drawbacks were that the room faintly smelled like cigarettes, it was a non-smoking room but I think that the walls were thin next to the building beside the hotel, or smoking from the street below wafted up. It was enough to make me feel sick a few times. Also, the hotel room was stifling hot at night, and we had to sleep with the windows open, which led to noise at all times of the night in our room. The hotel is located on a very busy street, which is great, but it is noisy until about 2 or 3 am most nights. One morning I woke up at about 6"

You are even provided with a pot full of ear plugs, cotton buds and any little extra you may have forgotten to bring. There is even a shower puff provided!

It's a 5 minute walk from all the Metro and RER lines at Chatelet-Les Halles (which means you can take the RER B train from CDG, take exit 3 out of the station, and walk a few minutes to get to the hotel). The neighborhood that the hotel's in is lively and interesting, and it's just a short walk to some very nice shopping streets like Rue Montorgueil and Rue Rambuteau.

I prefer to sleep with the windows open so noise was a problem for me. The area has lively bars and can be quite noisy - especially if there is a soccer match - well into the evening (midnight).

Overall we would definitely look at staying here the next time we go for a weekend. Thanks to everyone

My room was a good size and very clean. The hotel is well looked after and common parts very attractive. A couple of areas for improvement: the carpet in a corner of my room was in a terrible state, like it had been eaten by moth or just worn to the threads. It just brought down the whole room. As did the freestanding cupboard: when all the furnishing was so nice, this looked a bit like a super cheap unit, painted, which stuck out a bit. Lastly, although I was on the 6th floor, at 6.30am I could smell the fumes of breakfast being prepared. Ventilation of the kitchen should be better separated from the rooms"

Reception gave me clear written directions from the train station, which metro to take to Etolle Militaire stop to walk 2 blocks to the hotel.

A multi-generational trip to France might have been daunting, pandemic aside. What a pleasure to find such a gem of a hotel, perfectly located with the amazing front of house staff only too happy to offer advice or make arrangements for your stay.

Like many reviewer‘s have said, the location is wonderful. We walked Rue Cler daily. Lots of nice bakeries, restaurants,  stores, chocolatiers, etc. We got a deluxe room with Eiffel tower view. The view was spectacular (see pictures). The breakfast was very good with many options. The bed was very comfortable. We had a room with a tub/shower combination, which was nice. Staff were very helpful. Traveling during Covid was complicated. Hotel staff recommended a pharmacy that was both convenient in location and also offered a good price for their Covid testing. We did get EU Covid passes (one came prior to departure and the other arrived in our email shortly after check-in). Highly recommend applying for EU Covid pass prior to departure."

The rooms are larger than most small Parisian hotels and very comfortable.  The hotel has a very relaxed, friendly atmosphere.   This will be the special place that I always come back to when in Paris.  The location is perfect; on a quiet side street with Rue Cler steps away on one side and the wonderful Avenue de la Bourdonnais on the other side.  The Champs de Mar is only 3 blocks away.   There is also a metro stop a couple of blocks away.   Staying at Hotel Bosquet gives you a quiet haven but gives you the excitement of Paris just minutes away."

They had the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. The room was much smaller than expected, however, but we made do. The customer service was very friendly and accommodating.

The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms new and nicely stocked and the breakfast spread was substantial.  All good, but the best was the staff.  They were helpful even before we arrived.  My email queries were responded to promptly.  Their list of restaurant was recommendations extensive and the front desk  helped with museum reservations and airport transport.

Rooms are handsomely decorated, lighting is excellent, and the double-glazed windows keep out extraneous noises (though there really aren't any on this quiet side street just off des Champs Elysées). If you are a five-star hotel client but have found things at that level beginning to get maybe a little expensive, consider a step sideways (I know, you may consider it a step down, but it really isn't) and take a look at this comfortable, personable little hotel.

I always go back to it as I am welcomed back like a family member. Service is very professional, room and amenities excellent. Breakfast plentiful. Everyone is very discreetly COVID aware without it being overdone but it is efficient. Location as other reviews have mentioned is excellent and even in the street there is an al night small supermarket and you don’t have to go all the way to the Champs Elysées to find a good restaurants some are around the corner.  If you come by car public parking is close by and you can get a discount through the hotel.  Thanks to Christian and all his staff for their welcome, professionalism and friendliness. Does Christian ever stop? He is always there when you need him and more than happy"

Rooms were also well-appointed.  The worst was the noise. We had a street-facing room, and we could hear the traffic as well as the laughter of people enjoying late nights/early mornings using the outside seating of the restaurants in the street. It is true that the street is not very busy, but that does not help with the talking and laughter or when every once in a while, a super noisy scooter speeds through.  The issue is basically the choice of windows—ones with 2 panes instead of 3, and, in particular, ones that have a permanent ventilation opening that cannot be closed and lets the noise straight through.

One tiny negative which is why I didn’t give 5 stars, breakfast was very nice but not in abundance."

Loved the location, which is perfect for shopping and going out. The hotel is nice, very differently decorated but is perfectly functional.

The decor was chic, interesting and quirky, but the rooms are sparse and small. Worse than that, my room had the smallest bed I have ever slept in - I'm 6'3"" and my legs were about 1 1/2 feet over the end when I like down ! I thought it was for a childs bed. What made itbworse was the plastic under sheet !   I didn't sleep at all.  Combine this with cheap amenities, thin, cheap towels (1 only) and one small shampoo.  Sad, because I've stayed in most of the business hotels in that area of Paris now and this is my worst experience."

The staff is very nice, helpful and professional. The hotel is really cute: it's centered around music, and all the rooms are tastefully decorated following this theme without going overboard. The rooms are quite small (but it's the norm in Paris) clean, and comfortable. The location is really what makes this hotel stand out. There are grocery stores, stores (Zara, Massimo Dutti etc.), restaurants, bakeries and bars in the same block. Galeries Lafayette, le Printemps, and l'Opéra de Paris are within walking distance. The area is really safe, and fun. I have to mention the ""adult"" shops: some of the rooms have a view on them. It wasn't a problem for us, there was nothing shocking, however, you might want to think about it if"

It wasn't bad, just not as exceptional as other small, similarly priced hotels in Paris.  Positives included a helpful front desk, clean and modern facilities, good location, quiet rooms.  Negatives were an amazingly hard bed - I like firm beds, but this was beyond that - an air conditioning system that was hard to control and blew air directly in your face all night, a (not unusual) small, inadequate glass shield only partly blocking the shower from spraying all over the bathroom.  Many people would find this OK, but it's not hard to do better for the same price."

Their effortless attention to detail yet relaxed atmosphere is a dream combination.  Their ability to organise things for you and take care of everything was amazing.

First, booking this experience as an English speaker living in the Midwest trying to make everything perfect for my husband’s birthday trip to Paris was EASY. Yes, you’re reading that right. EASY! Easier than booking a hotel in Chicago or anywhere in the U.S. Why you ask? Because their packages include everything you need before you even book.

I thought it would have been bigger but it was very comfortable and the bed was wonderful with good quality linens.  The room and bathroom were a bit old fashioned and dated but it was fine for a few days. There wasn't much spare space for baggage so if there are 2 of you with 20kg bags you might  struggle.  The location was spot on and was just off the Rue de Lepic and just down the hill from the Montmartre area with loads of bars and good restaurants in close proximity. The Place du Clichy was within easy walking distance as was the Moulin Rouge if you re into that sort of thing.   I would go back here. Thanks to the very friendly staff.

The main floor lobby is very clean. There is an option of buffet breakfast although this wasn’t included with my stay. The room was kept very clean each day. Free Nespresso coffee was provided in the reception, as well as a free thea in the room. Staff was very friendly and courteous specially the young man always smiling. You are required to pay a small city taxes fee per night. We stayed in a superior room. I would recommend this hotel for family and couple."

Hotel rooms and bathroom appear more spacious than usual in Paris. The room is clean and very comfortable and in the bathroom, they provide you daily with nice utilities of Rituals.  Breakfast is good (15€/day) but only had it once. Still, I think if you have a bit of time, there’s plenty of cafes and boulangeries nearby which offer a more authentic Paris breakfast feeling (as quite common in Paris, the breakfast room is on the lower level (-1) in a kind of basement environment.  Also, location is perfect. Just so close to Rue Abbesses with all its bars, cafes and restaurants and close to many tourist spots (Sacre Coeur, Moulin Rouge). Metro „Blanche“ is just 5min walking distance."

We found the hotel well-placed for exploring the city on foot (the Metro being on strike), but particularly for visiting the area around the Sacre Coeur.  An added bonus was listening to the impromptu jazz quartet that set up on the corner on Sunday morning.  The staff were always very friendly and the provision of a complimentary coffee when we came back to retrieve our bags after we'd checked out was most welcome."

Although the space was small, the rooms were well-equipped and decorated with antiques and rustic beams on the ceiling.

On the day of the check-out, we were around 30 minutes past the check-out time when we were basically kicked out of our suite, due to the fact that evidently they had to prepare the hotel for some visiting dignitaries and their retinue. This left a very sour taste in my mouth, as it is generally understood, especially among this caliber of hotels, that one has a little bit of flexibility upon checkout (up to an hour).

The location could not be beat. It was a few minute walk to the metro and only a couple more to the Eiffel Tower.

The problem came when they stated that the room was handicapped accessible. Not even the entry was accessible. There were stairs and a smaller than average doorways. The bathroom was very small and the toilet room was so small that not only the door would not open farther than 1/3 of the way but you had to straddle the toilet to close the door. The biggest problem was that the room was too small. I know that Paris has small rooms but this was like a closet. I am not exaggerating. There was also construction so ask if there still is any, as it was very loud."

Location is 5-10 minutes walk from the Eiffel Towerand plenty of nice bars and restaurants... Yet the hotel itself is very quiet and relaxing after a long day of site seeing. Very pricey area though! So be prepared to spend £100 on a meal in the evening for two... Hotel was a small compact boutique that offers bed and breakfast.. Waking up to the smell of fresh croissant was a win.. Friendly staff at reception. Room was very small, however, for a short city break for 2 this was just fine! Price was no different from 3 nights at a Premier inn in the UK. Would recommend!"

No lift to the room as you can see by the spiral staircase photos. No offer of assistance to the room with baggage for my 70yr parents. Walls paper thin I could here kids yelling at all hours. The a/c is not controlled by you in your room. The door key had to be left with front desk for the day. It’s 2019 invest in proper doors locks!!! The male at the front desk clerk was extremely rude.  Camille you were lovely and tried to make up but at some point you have to cut your losses.  The food for breakfast what food??? Eggs not cooked, 2 baguettes small pieces of cheese a feeble pieces of ham etc. Disappointing! Decent location the Eiffel Tower was close and that is the best I can say for this"

The staff was very welcoming and willing to assist from the moment we arrived. Arriving on a Saturday, we had concerns about the protest but they immediately pulled out a map and explained areas we should avoid. The rooms were on the smaller size - to be expected but were clean and well kept. Planning to be out for the majority of the day and returning late at night we were a little hesitant that we had to leave our hotel key at the desk but there was always someone there when we arrived back at night. The location was great to easily travel by metro and the staff was more than willing to accommodate holding our luggage on our last day. Would certainly recommend!"

On arrival we left our bags as we were before the room was ready and on return our bags were put into our room and coats hung up in the wardrobe which was great. The hotel room was a great size, bathroom where toilet is a little small but great room and the beds so comfy. We were able to add breakfast on the morning if we wanted when we woke up and the staff were really friendly. As we didn't know Paris very well the reception member got the map and identified all the main tourist attractions, the two metro stations which the hotel is between and also gave us some great restaurants to visit which helped up a lot throughout the few days we stayed. Would highly recommend staying here!"

It is well positioned for a short city break - 30mins from Gard du Nord on the Metro.  The facilities provided were good - clean room, comfy bed, ensuite.  I was surprised though at what was not included in the room: wifi is available but costs extra; tea and coffee facilities are in reception not the room and again there is a charge. There was a safe but no key provided - I assumed it similarly cost extra (but may be wrong).  So 3/5 because those things I would expect as standard were not provided without additional payment. Other than that it is a nice hotel in an excellent location."

We experienced the wonderful Paris Friday traffic jams lol. When we arrived we received a warm welcome from the lovely man at reception it was quick! He gave us a map with all the locations and told us the nearest metro station. Stayed in room 504 was a nice room my only criticism is that control of the aircon should be done from the room as I had to ask the receptionist but that was no bother as we did this when left in the morning to then come back to a very cool room as the weather was amazing and very hot. I certainly would recommend this hotel for its location and the cafes & restaurant are just amazing. Thank you Hotel Longchamp Elysees.

The hotel is a small family affair where the front desk and other staff know you by name after the first night.  It is close to two Metro lines (and within walking distance to the Bois de Bologne, Champs Elysees, Eiffel Tower, Trocodero museums, and more) and there are many good restaurants (bistros, Chinese, Sushi, Portuguese, patisseries). The accommodations are first rate, and the amenities are superior.  Looking forward to visiting again, and soon."

The reason why I can only give 3 stars is because when we arrived, there were ongoing refurbishment work from 9 am every morning mon-fri right opposite our room, the hotel did not inform us of any work being done nor did they offer a different room away from the work, if I have to listen to drills and hammers from 9 am with no discount/heads up the hotel cannot get a better rating than average.

I asked for a room change after my first night, and they were incredibly obliging, even sending me a personalized note apologizing for the fact I wasn't 100% satisfied with my original room! (wow...).  I wouldn't necessarily advise this hotel for the business traveller (although it worked for me) - but it seems perfect as a 'base' for a Paris tourist.

Everyone made us feel incredibly welcome and valued, especially as a Hilton Honors member.

We stayed in two different rooms at the Niepce Paris Hotel due to splitting our trip between Paris and London. We stayed in a suite and a deluxe room. Our experience at this hotel was FABULOUS! The hotel is beautiful and the hospitality was great. Our concierge was excellent and he worked most days and nights we were at the hotel. This hotel is located a few blocks from the Perenty metro station. It is an easy walk to close restaurants and grocery stores. This hotel is located in a more residential area and we felt safe. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.

Sat in the 14th arrondissement, you are a short walk away from various shops, bars, cafes, restaurants and the Metro. The rooms are wonderfully presented, clean and cared for. The staff are helpful and cater for those of us with little more than a rudimentary grasp of the French language. My only complaint was breakfast. I felt it was limited and the quality vs price wasn't what I've grown accustomed to in my many travels."

We had a wonderful time.  The staff was extraordinary. Every interaction we had with them  was pleasant and they patiently helped me with my atrocious French even though they all spoke perfect English.   Nine nights is plenty of time to tire of a place and plenty of time for them to tire of you.  But, we never tired of the Hotel Niepce and the staff was just as charming the day we left as the day we arrived. We walked and took buses everywhere because the Metro was down and every night we would be thrilled to return to our little section of Montparnasse which felt completely non touristy as compared to some other neighborhoods.

I had the house wine which at 18 Euros a bottle was well priced. I also had the meat and cheese board for 15 Euros which easily fed two adults with loads left over, really generous. The staff could not have been more friendly, they were both fantastic. I forget the other guy´s name but he was amazing too.

Right from the check in to the check out, we were greeted by friendly and smiling staff. The room was small - as expected in Paris - but with a reasonably large and nice bathroom. Everything was in good condition. The breakfast was great. Not the biggest selection but quality items. Slightly cramped at times - a little wait for a table to be expected. Nice location in relation to metro lines and the neighborhood seemed peaceful and quiet. And then I have to mention that several times we saw the staff go glass - knives and forks etc. through to make sure it was perfectly clean - as it was at a Michelin starred restaurant. Would love to stay here again another time."

The only thing I was a little disappointed in was the small selection of food on our arrival back from the first day, tired and hungry, there was a small selection of wholesome snacks, as they don't have cooking facilities, and the food has to be preordered..we saw others eating it and it looked delicious , again wholesome and home made. I hesitate in recommending it as it is a jewel in a sea of expensive and crapy Parisienne hotels. Strangely the staff were lovely, all of them!, an achievement in Paris where redness seems to be norm. Bravi."

At first it comes off as chic in an odd way, but then it's clear it's more about marketing than the hotel itself. There are even weird signs everywhere encouraging guests to post photos on social media with the message, ""Be a good part of the community.""   True, the room are cute. Like many boutique hotels it's designed to look like a nice apartment rather than a hotel. The bed is also more comfortable than most hotel beds. However, I was shocked when I arrived because the room was by far the smallest of any hotel room I've ever stayed in. You have about one meter on either side of the bed and half that in front of it. The door to the toilet doesn't even fully open. This"

The COQ is owned by 2 sugar heirs,whose designers had a clever concept -  ""Community of Quality"" [""COQ"" - Rooster] - highlighting quirky decor and chickens that got lost when the hotel became a cash machine for the owners' new upscale venture.    I am genuinely fond of the staff who try their best.  Staff turnover has been significant an reallocated, and it shows.  The mascot pet silky chickens are dead (1) or ""rehomed"" (3).

It is the best of both worlds: like an AirBnB, you get an entire apartment in which to spread out, and like a hotel, you get hotel-like services including a front desk which can arrange transportation or provide a breakfast basket if you want these services. (We did not need breakfast, but did book transportation to Gare Montparnasse through the front desk for the next leg of our trip. Very appreciated!)   We booked a 5 night stay--July 25-30, 2021--in a 3 bedroom superior apartment. We got a survey BEFORE our stay to find out if we had any special requests.

A grocery store is one block away from the apartment and the apartment has a refrigerator and microwave. The Disneyland Paris bus pick-up location is 3 blocks from the apartment - also convenient!

I cannot comment on the views from the "" classic"" apartments but from the website , they appear to be on lower floors. This place was great.

When we arrived we had trouble getting in - you have to push the door hard and enter through the hallway to the left where you will be greeted by a polite receptionist. He upgraded our room on arrival which was a nice surprise to a 3 bedroom instead of 2.  The apartment was exceptionally clean and big! We had no complaints whatsoever and it was more than adequate for one night to enjoy a day trip. Overall our stay was enjoyable and we would certainly look to stay here again in future."

For the price it was well worth it. Being that this isn’t a hotel, you do have to keep in mind there’s no housekeeping and certain amenities are limited other than what’s provided in the apartment.  I would say things were a little outdated, so I was underwhelmed staying in the apartment suite aside from  just sleeping.   However, stepping outside the door and having access to the Eiffel Tower, as well as being within walking distance to parks, shops and restaurants made up for it.   I probably wouldn’t stay here again, but I would still recommend it."

The location is great - it's just off a busy street so that it wasn't very crowded but close enough that I could walk to local cafes for breakfast.
Fred Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g187147-d529916-Reviews-or10-Fred_Hotel-Paris_Ile_de_France.html#REVIEWS,"A clean hotel with friendly staff. We stayed for 5 days while we toured around Paris. It's in a pretty good position for this. The nearest metro station is a few minutes walk away (Plaisance ) and only 20 mins ride  most of the main sites of interest; Champs Elyssee, Eiffel Tower Last louvre etc. The staff are all very helpful and friendly. All the reception guys speak good English.  Breakfast is continental style self service. It can get a little crowded but all on all not bad. In the local area there are several bars, restaraunts, take aways, wine shops and a small supermarket so you can easily cater for any food needs nearby. A short cab ride into the centre of the Montparnasse area will put you in the way of many good Brasserie.  Next time we are in Paris I will check the"

I liked the style a lot, and I would also recommend this hotel to everyone else on a private trip as well! For sure during the summer days the hotel is probably very full and not as affordable as during our stay in early May, but totally worth a visit it if you have the chance."

He claimed that we hadn’t paid for the stay (we were charged by the other nice gentleman when we checked in), when we pulled up our Amex transaction record to show him proof of payment (hotel name, address, DATE  and amount etc.) he dismissed us by saying ‘how do I know it was for this trip?’. Yup you read it right! He basically called us liars! Then he decided to ‘confirm’ with the other gentleman who had checked us in by calling him.

The hotel is super close to the business district and also a good starting point to explore the city. You have appr. 20’ by feet to the Louvre, 45’ by feet to the Eiffel Tower along the river Seine so it’s really well located.

While the room wasn't particularly large it was adequate, well-furnished, and equipped with a nice firm mattress and modern bathroom amenities. The hotel is superbly located (less than 5 min walk from RoissyBus, Opera, and Lafayette Gallery) yet very quiet, and its breakfast, generous and of high quality, deserves a special mention. More importantly, the hotel offers an open bar from 14:00 with considerable choice of snacks, fruits, and soft drinks - and a similar bar is offered in all 17 Astotel's properties all around Paris! The place comes highly recommended. TIP: For a novel window view and quieter sleep, ask for inside room."

They really care about you and go the extra mile to make sure you are happy.  All the time.

The rooms are very clean and have a stocked fridge with free soft drinks and water which is very nice.  And there is also coffee/tea in the room.   The one downside is that for all the rooms that face the interior (which is all but two), the elevator shaft makes a clunking sound every time it moves.  And it is a deep and for me, loud clunk.   I am really surprised that more people don’t comment on this.  I couldn’t sleep though it even with ear plugs.  Eventually the elevator"

The room was spacious for 2 of us and had all the facilities we needed. Breakfast was a nice selection and the staff were friendly. Free soft drinks each day is a great bonus!  Be aware that there are construction works on the facade of the building - this isn't mentioned upon booking or arrival! The workmen were on scaffolding literally outside our window all day (on the 3rd floor), so we could never open the curtains or window, making our room very dark and damp after using the shower. The workmen began making noise at 8.15am every single day, drilling and banging on our wall, and continued this until late afternoon!

Still like this little hotel, mainly for its great location for shopping as well as for the restaurants around.  The room for a solo traveller while compact is cosy. With the ongoing works to the facade/roof which is accessed by the workmen from the courtyard, it can get quite noisy after 8a.m when they start work.   The Astotel chain of hotels boasts of an ""open bar concept"" where clients can have drinks and snacks from 1.00 - 10.00 pm.

We actually walked to all of the landmarks including, Sacred Coeur, Eiffel Tower, Champs Elysees,  Notre Dame, etc.  THE LOCATION IS THE HOTEL'S BEST FEATURE!  We initially went into the hotel next door because this hotel is very narrow and we didn't notice the entrance which was surrounded by scaffolding.

It was within walking distance to tourist spots like the Eiffel Tower and is also located right beside two metro stations which make getting to other locations very easy.   The staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay despite our lack of French  We had missed our room cleaning time as we had slept a bit later in the day but one of the ladies at reception very kindly arranged for our room to be cleaned a bit later.

The Hotel Odessa offers much better service and accommodations than 3 and 4 star hotels we have stayed at.  The neighborhood is safe, has an array of good restaurants and cafes, is close to transportation, and is walking distance to many major sites.  The rooms are very clean, comfortable, and efficient.  The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are large and clean.  The air conditioning is a welcome on a muggy day, and the WiFi worked great.  The French breakfast served at the door is delicious and an excellent start to keep you going all day until dinner.  The most important amenity are the people.

Old building but well maintained. All staff at the reception is really kind and friendly. We will stay at this place again when/ if we go back to Paris.

The room was small and outdated. The walls were very thin, you could hear the conversation in the next room; old doors which made very loud noise, especially when people came in late at night or left early in the morning. Good thing I had ear plugs, or else I wouldn't have been able to sleep very much. After we checked in, we realized the room hadn't been cleaned properly. Trash from the previous occupants was still in the bathroom. We asked at the reception for someone to come clean it, but nothing was done until the next day when they normally cleaned the room. The room had a bad odor, probably from old rugs. On the positive side, the location of the hotel is very good. Lots of restaurants and bistros nearby, a Metro stop"

We wanted something close to Gare Montparnasse and Tour Montparnasse.  The Odessa filled this need very nicely.  Our room (#53) had a small balcony wrapping around the corner on the fifth floor so we had a 270-degree view.  We had dinner just a couple of blocks away at the café at the top of Tour Montparnasse after taking photos of the Eiffel Tower at sunset and the rest of Paris spread out below us.  In the morning it was a short walk to Gare Montparnasse to catch the TGV headed south.  Like many hotels in the mid price range, the rooms are not spacious, but for our short-term purposes it was fine.  If you are making connections out of Montparnasse I recommend without hesitation."

I travel to Paris at least once a year and i have tried many different hotels. Considering the price, this is by far the best place i have stayed. It's a two-star hotel so one has to be reasonable. Rooms are small and basic. But the neighborhood is excellent and you there are so many shops and bars, cafes and restaurants that frankly you don't feel the lack of, for example, a coffee maker! Also, the staff are so nice and helpful and professional. This is a little gem and I hope they don't increase the price.

I should have read some of the negative reviews on here as there are consistent themes of opportunistic over charging, bad service and sub-par basic facilities expected for even a 3 star hotel never mind a hotel classing themselves as a 4 star!

The museum’s, stores, banks, and Metro were all closed, as were most cafes. The Melia Vendom’s excellent service, comfort and amenities made our trip truly memorable. Additionally, the hotel provided security, and the few times we walked a few blocks, the Concierge would go with us."

Others have commented on the less than welcoming receptionists.  Also, when we visited the lobby was being renovated. The rooms are small but functional. The location is however fantastic, just by the Tuileries.  The main reason I chose this one was because of the swimming pool that was advertised on the website, but actually it doesn’t exist and when I pointed this out to the receptionist he shrugged his shoulders in the great offhand Parisian tradition.   I see this reference to a pool has now been deleted from their website, so maybe I was listened to.   Better to stay in the suburbs or get an Air BnB, and spend what you’ve saved on metro tickets and"

First, the service across the board was fabulous - all staff were friendly, attentive and lightening quick with any request. We were welcomed by the manager on two separate occasions with champagne and macaroons. We had a junior suite on the first floor (really the second floor) that had two separate rooms and two bathrooms. Bed was great! Street noise was not an issue. We used our sound app at night and the daily hustle and bustle of a Paris street was to be expected. Having the breakfast included in our rate was a great choice! The LOCATION is the best anywhere across Paris. Eating at Flottes and Le Souffle, as well as the Vendome Bar made this stay feel like we were in our own Paris neighborhood.  We will return!"

We found the Hotel Dauphin St Germain and it perfectly fit our needs. The St. Germain neighborhood was walkable to the Notre Dame cathedral and the louvre. It was safe for my teens to run along the Seine in the morning- and was highly convenient for bakeries and dinners in the evening . The metro was very close to take us to other tourist spots such as the Eiffel Tower.

The room has everything one needs if staying in paris: a great bed and shower to restore after 30,000 steps of walking. I also had to take some work meetings and wifi was extremely reliable. The only thing to know is that street is busy at night and can take a while for things to cool down. I was personally not bother but other maybe. You cannot have it all!"

I would have returned for the cost/value but in leaving I left a hanging luggage insert toiletry bag (one where the clear plastic reveals the contents).

It is opposite Gare de l'est and within walking distance to gare du nord, so if you are going to take the train there it is perfect. The rooms are quiet and clean and fit their description so if you are by yourself a small room is fine and if you need more space you should book a slightly more expensive, larger room. A strict covid-19 protocol is followed and you feel entirely safe.  I really recommend this hotel if you are looking for a clean, convenient and safe place to stay."

You also have to queue for ages to speak to someone as there's only ever one person on the counter.   The hotel itself is small and basic, the rooms are like your standard Travelodge except smaller and perhaps more basic. Despite its central location, Gare de l'Est is not a very nice area of Paris.   There are definitely vastly better hotels you can get for a much cheaper rate."

Luckily it is easy to find Police around, I asked the way to go to Gare de l'Est and in fact it's very very easy just turn right and walk straight along the main street until end.

But thousand of ant crawling into the bath and room. There seemed an ant hole in the corner of the bath. I told the counter and they changed my room to where smaller than before and heating system was not working. I told the counter but they just let me wait. So I had to wait till the last of my staying in coldness. The man who came to my room for checking heater smelled terrible, so I had to open a window in midnight to let fresh air in. Also, I found the cup I used at the first day still remained till the last day of may staying.   Never recommend this hotel."

When I first arrived to the hotel I was about 2 hours early before check in and was really tired because I had taken an overnight flight from the US, got a ride to the Opera area from the airport (dropped some luggage at another location there), and walked 20+ blocks to the Libertel hotel.

We didn't make this mistake on our return trip, that said there are many quite intimidating characters that hang around Gard Du Nord trying to sell cigarettes etc. We simply ignored them, I don't think we'd have done the journey after dark. The hotel is lovely and simple and perfect for a mini break. Reception is clean, smart and inviting.

Room: I paid for the bigger room supposedly for two. When I walked in I figured they must have made a mistake and given me the small room for one. But no, this was the big room. I don't want to know how small the small room was! That said it was clean, the bed was fine, the bathroom large and had a very nice soaking tub.      Not so good stuff. Broken AC/Heather. I couldn't even get the fan to come on. They offered to move me to a different room, but it would have been closer to the street and even more noisy than this one."

I was traveling alone and was “upgraded” to a deluxe room. It is on the lobby floor and I was skeptical that it would be loud, but I surprisingly didn’t hear much. I kept the window open so the air inside the room wasn’t so stuffy. I always sleep with a soft white noise sound and I never awoke to any loud sounds or people.   The room was spacious with a king bed and a day bed. The bathroom had a separate shower and bath.

Hotel Left Bank Saint Germain,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g187147-d207573-Reviews-or15-Hotel_Left_Bank_Saint_Germain-Paris_Ile_de_France.html#REVIEWS,This was our last stay in Paris after 3 weeks in France. When we stepped into the hotel our breath was taken away. What a beautiful hotel with its period furiture. We booked the top floor suite #604. When we stepped in we were surprised by the size of it. Just perfect for our family including two kids. The views were amazing. The flowers behind the windows were a delight. We could see the Notre Dame and Eiffel tower and the rooftops of Paris. The a/c was perfect as all the other hotels we stayed in allowed the a/c to only go down to 20 degrees celcius. The breakfast was wonderful. Cannot go wrong with 5 euros per person. The food was fresh and the service was great. Anytime we needed help with any questions or tips was provided by the front desk. They helped getting a large van

The room was very charming.  The furniture is fitting of the style of the hotel--not brand new but well loved and properly maintained.  The bathroom has been remodeled with updated fixtures and flooring.  The location was perfect.  Just steps from a metro station and taxi stand.  Less than a mile walk to the Louvre.  Many food options nearby.  We felt very safe in the neighborhood and enjoyed every bit of our stay.  I was beyond thrilled to be able to see the Eiffel Tower from one side of our room and Notre Dame (or what remains at this time) from the other side.  I would not hesitate to stay here again!

We were in Paris with my sister’s family. We stayed at this hotel while they stayed on the Champs Elysses at a $900 a night hotel. After visiting them at their hotel, all I could think of was how much I liked our hotel better! Their hotel felt cold and without character.   Hotel Left Bank is in a super cute neighborhood. The rooms were quaint and felt Parisian. Having Eric Kayser across the street doesn’t hurt either. Metro was right down the street. I thought the location was awesome. Everything felt really close.   There were 3 of us staying in Paris. Our room had one Queen size bed and a single bed. Both were very comfy. Bathroom was nice size and great layout.   I’d totally stay there again and I was happy with the price."

The location is outstanding and so if that is the key consideration then this hotel is for you. Otherwise the decor of the hotel is dated, our room had a stale smell to it, the breakfast very average and the service nothing notable.  One bonus is a wonder boulangerie across the road that is perfect for breakfast!"

I was pleasantly surprised by the Family Room I had booked, which was large enough for all 3 of us to feel at home and comfortable.  Hotel Left Bank has it all - effective air conditioning in a city where that is not always the case, comfortable beds,a  large and impeccably clean bathroom, a vintage French feel.  It is great value for the money and a lovely experience."

Situated in what feels like a very real area of Paris, with excellent cafes, bars and boulangeries just around the corner. We even managed to park our car with trailer on the street for the duration of our stay.   Thanks to the staff who accommodated our bikes in their courtyard (the first time, there were thirty of us, the second time just four).   There's a Metro at the end of the street (150 metres away) and you can walk to Eiffel Tower, which is around two miles and Paris is pretty flat!   Beds are comfy, prices are reasonable. En suites are decent and our rooms came with traditional, tall French windows, which adds a huge amount to the experience."

However, their service was becoming improved day by day and I got very satisfied with it on my check-out day.  3. Cleanliness : Room is very small, but very clean. There are separate spaces for toilet and shower room with sink. Each door was very useful to block the bedroom from them. 4. No soundproof wall : This is the only thing that the hotel should improve if possible."

There was a nice sized, comfy bed as well as a desk and a TV. The bathroom was quite small but there was enough room in there for two people. There was a clean shower and fresh towels every day.  The only downside to our stay was that we had a room on the ground floor which wouldn't have been a problem but the room got very, very warm during the day (even though it was only October!). Upon arriving back, we wanted to open the window but felt like we couldn't as the street outside was fairly busy and we didn't want people looking in.  Overall this hotel was perfect for a short stay however as this hotel does not have aircon I wouldn't stay during the warmer months."

The hotel is fine. Location is great. About 5-10 minutes walk to Tour Montparnasse and 1 minute walk to the nearest metro station (Pernety - line 13). Reception staff very friendly and spoke English. The room is small but clean. You're in the centre of Paris so a big room would be highly expensive. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel as we went to the city to eat out. The hotel is fine if you want what we want; just a reasonably priced room that for most of the time you only use for sleeping. The next door parking garage service is great if you travel by car.

Firstly the rooms are tiny, so lucky I was by myself or you couldn’t have fit another person in that room. Secondly the shower was tiny, if you drop anything you won’t be able to pick it up. Thirdly pack ear plugs, I could hear people snoring in the room next to me at night, and the cleaning staff start vacuuming ridiculously early. You can also hear a lot of noises at night and during the day. The last thing that really irritated me was I came back to the room one afternoon to find they were changing the door handles. They had about 3 tradesman in my room. They did not notify guests that they were doing repairs during my stay. I also had a lot of valuables that could not all fit in the safe, I also didn’t"

We had a hearty continental breakfast the first morning, at an added cost, but chose to walk to a nearby bakery for coffee and pastries the next day.

Unfortunately, the general transportation strike made it not likely that we could get to the hotel, and-more importantly- from the hotel to the airport the next morning to fly home.  This meant we needed to cancel our reservation and stay at the airport, which is what we did.  The staff at the Notre Dame could not have been more generous and prompt with their help in accomplishing this for us.

If you are not young and fit or have small lite bags the stairs are quite dangerous. There is no porter or help available.

This hotel totally met these requirements.  It's right across the street from the nearest exit (there are quite a few exits for this stop, St-Michel Notre-Dame - be sure to follow signs for Norte Dame).  The hotel is right on the corner, checkin/lobby on second - so will have to lug any baggage up a flight of narrow stairs from the street entrance.  From the lobby there is a shoebox sized elevator - just enough for 2 people or 2 suitcases but not all together. Room we booked was ""double with view of river or Notre Dame"""

The wonderful staff at this small but meticulously maintained hotel at a busy intersection cheerfully greeted me each day, and my small but well-appointed corner room provided an incredible view of all that went on outside and below. I quickly adjusted as well to the small bathroom that was similar to what I've experienced during my couple of other trips to Europe.

The double bed was against the wall, too hard to get in for someone who isn't a skinny contortionist. The wall side of the bed is pushed up by the bed frame, so was like sleeping on a ledge, with the feeling of falling down the slope onto your partner.  The toilet is the tiniest cupboard - my arm kept knocking off the light and my knees were against the door, which had to be open to clean oneself - you need to be a very unusually close family.

He told me they didn't have any bed bugs on the 1st floor and they've only had them on the 4th floor (!). He then told me I likely brought the bugs in. Despite that and the fact that I didn't see any signs of bugs in the new room they put us in, I decided to stay to avoid the stress of trying to find a new hotel in a foreign land.

I thought it would be a great location to stay in. While the location was nice, the actual hotel was atrocious. There were several live spiders in the room, it reeked of mold, and It was as if someone hadn't cleaned the place since the 1700's. The staff hung up on me when I called to ask a question about my luggage that they wouldn't let me bring upstairs when I checked in because ""it was too late at night.""

Now, I like hotels with character and this has it, but I was a little disappointed. I think to truly enjoy Esmeralda, you need to stay in a larger room (I was in a single on the 4th floor) that faces Notre Dame. That's the key.

We could view Notre Dame from our window and stroll easily to the Metro/RER( bue line). Lots of cafes and restaurants nearby, including great bakeries for breakfast. The staff were great and gave us good information. It was fun to see all our fellow tourists come to take selfies in front of the Shakespeare Bookshop next door and to think we were staying in a part of the same building. Our room was small and basic (door touched the bed when open and the shower was rudimentary, no coffee or tea available) but we savored the character of this hotel. There's even a children's book that it features in!"

We were on the top floor with a view of notre dame. The rooms are quirky but not disappointing. There are no coffee making facilities, no TV, no bar etc in the hotel but that it reflected in the price and it is clean. But the location is so good you really want to get out and about. The best of all was the wonderful service from Francisco. He was so helpful and knowledgeable and really wanted us to enjoy Paris, which we did. Thank you for a lovely holiday"

I read really good reviews about this hotel and loved the location. I have to say it exceeded my expectations. We arrived around 11.15am and it was pouring with rain. Fransisco made us so welcome. He said give us 15 minutes and we'll get the room cleaned for you. He chatted to us telling us the history of the hotel, my daughter spoke some French. We've never felt to welcome at a hotel. I knew there wasn't a lift and were in room 12. Yes its dated etc but its so French and full of character. Amazing view of the notre dame and a lovely park. Location is amazing. The train from and to airport is a minutes walk from hotel. Lots of lovely places to eat and the Shakespeare book company around the corner. We were given an"

For the rest the rooms are really small. Not well heated and very low quality of the finishes.  The curtain are not blinds curtains so the sunlight will enter in the room in the early morning.  The window is just a frame and single glass and not isolating at all.  The bed sheets are cleaned but in bad condition and very old. The bathroom is very basic as per pictures attached.   I tried to change room but it was the other rooms are more or less the same.

On the third day my fearless wife had put her hand into the 'drainage hole' and pulled out the bunch of hair left there by the guests living in this room before.

The hotel is in a great location, reasonably priced, central to many things we wanted to do with corresponding Metro lines, and on a street with great cafes, restaurants, a small grocery store and wonderful bakery for the best bread.  We had decided to stay on this side of the Seine and we are glad we did.  So many things to do in Paris.  We need to come back.  Finally, and most importantly, our concierge Sanjay was very helpful, knowledgeable and always very friendly.  It was a treat to see him each day."

After a long transatlantic flight, i got to the hotel at 13:00 but the receptionist refused to grant me access to the room as check-in time is 15:00. They later gave me the room at around 14:20.   The location of the hotel is great and the room design is nice but that’s all there is to it. The service is very slow and they seem to be understaffed. Despite leaving the clean the room sign at the door, i left the room one day for four hours in the morning and came back to find my room just as i left it. I had to call the concierge to request the cleaning lady and it took her 15 minutes to come over and clean the room.  Lastly, despite the not so cheap cost of the room, water pressure in the shower was horrendous. I am"

I love boutique hotels and what more can I say about St Germain. Best room is 100 and Sanjay never disappoints. He’s the lead concierge and arranges cry thing for you.

The hotel is, as many reviewers have said, right in the heart of what I believe is the nicest part of Paris.  Much of the best of Paris is walkable, and the network of narrow streets around it is full of restaurants and atmosphere.  I would like to especially thank the ladies at reception. Unfortunately, I didn't get their names but there are three ladies we saw at various times and all of them are fabulous. They genuinely want to help, were patient with our request to change rooms and helped us fill out the UK Passenger Locator Form, which is no easy task.  A small, friendly hotel, nicely decorated in a fabulous part of Paris."

We stayed at the Artus in the first half of March 2020, in the Exclusive Suite on the 6th floor of the hotel. This is a boutique hotel and we always felt like VIPs while we were staying there.  The suite can work as a large couples’ area or as two connected rooms for a family set-up. Both rooms have a private sink and toilet; the master bedroom also has a jacuzzi and a very luxurious shower. The tub and shower are open to the bedroom. There is a nice balcony which runs the length of the room and has lights (it took me three days to find them - look behind the curtain on the closet side). The layout of the suite makes this a larger-feeling, more flexible and more private space than you would think for the description on the website.  One"

Positives: The rooms are large for what you would expect in central Paris, and very clean. The staff are friendly and helpful.  Neutral: the elevator may be the smallest I have ever seen, which I actually enjoyed, but others with claustrophobic tendencies may find distressing.  Negative (mild): my room's toilet leaked slowly, which meant there was a trickling sound all night. The room was slightly too dark, as the windows faced into a courtyard.

Hotel Brittany,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g187147-d228823-Reviews-or{}-Hotel_Brittany-Paris_Ile_de_France.html#REVIEWS,"This hotel is very central in Paris, easy walking distance to the sacred heart cathedral. Positives: The rooms are large for what you would expect in central Paris, and very clean. The staff are friendly and helpful.  Neutral: the elevator may be the smallest I have ever seen, which I actually enjoyed, but others with claustrophobic tendencies may find distressing.  Negative (mild): my room's toilet leaked slowly, which meant there was a trickling sound all night. The room was slightly too dark, as the windows faced into a courtyard.  On balance, strongly recommended."

Good sized bathroom and nicely decorated lobby. Bar wasn’t open at any time and a Paris pass was delivered that reception denied any knowledge, it was only when Paris pass phoned reception they could be bothered finding it. Reception seemed pushy in getting us to take a taxi they recommend to the airport rather than we had booked and paid for."

Check in was easy and staff very pleasant throughout. Our room was a fairly small but typical of Paris hotels, a comfy bed and well decorated. A clean bathroom and good warm working shower. The location is excellent, not far from Gare du Nord main train station. The neighborhood is brilliant, lots of coffee shops and eateries within walking distance, Montmartre/Pigalle area approx 15 mins and Sacre Cour cathedrale 20-25 mins away."

Front desk was able to give us a fan and that made a big difference.   Comfy bed, wonderful soaker tub and windows that spill out into the courtyard.  Quiet.   Literally walk out the door and you are have cafes and shops waiting for you.  Only a few minutes walk to Galeries Lafayette and it’s breathtaking stain glassed ceiling.   Friendly staff, great location and comfortable rooms."
Hotel Brittany,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g187147-d228823-Reviews-or5-Hotel_Brittany-Paris_Ile_de_France.html#REVIEWS,"The location is very “parisien “, the neighborhood offering a wide range of specialities, gourmet, cafeteria, restaurants. For one person, the public transportation is ok, I came by RoissyBus from Ch de Gaule airport, 12 euros, one stop at Opéra.  The first night room was clean and nice, view on the street but very noisy and cold because the windows are not closing properly- if this issue will be settled, the room is ok. The air conditioning is not working in cold season so the only heating source was the bathroom heater, keeping the bathroom door open. The second night I change the room with a bigger and soundproofed one, but dark and sad - the backyard with walls! Here no heating at all; on my request they provide a mobile air flow device, I can’t used it during the night"

The room was ok but the shower was broken and you had to stand in it holding the shower 🚿 above your head which apparently is ok when we complained to the woman at reception next day and every morning we complained about the shower been broken but the"

Booked a standard double which was bard on the 4th floor. The room are on the small side but clean. Bathroom is adequate. There are tea and coffee facilities in the room but we had to leave reminders so room service would leave replacements! The hotel is in a superb location for the Notre-Dame Lorette metro and all the main shopping areas. Fare du Nord is a 15 minute walk and if you’re fit enough 20 minutes from the Sacre-Coure. Lots of bars and fabulous bistros nearby.

First stop Paris, we  picked Hotel Brittany due to its location specifically to Moulin Rouge but also its proximity to many attractions and a reasonable price.  Upon arrival we were slightly disappointed; tired after a ten hour flight we needed a quick nap and shower.  The room was very small and had some watermarking /discoloration on the ceiling and no view despite asking for a decent room upon check in.  I let the manager know that I had some issues with the room and that it was not exactly what we had in mind for our four days in Paris.  We were given a reasonable upgrade that really made the difference in our stay.  The staff were helpful and the hotel was really quite charming, the location was perfect for"

The hotel itself was beautifully kept, very nice and helpful staff who always had a smile on their faces.  The only downside to the hotel itself, is that there isn’t anywhere to get a coffee, apart from at breakfast and when we asked for milk, they said they only had cream!  As we were leaving, our bathroom seemed to have acquired a number of ants, not to sure where they were coming from! I would’ve mentioned it but we had to check out!  The Eiffel Tower, Notre Damn, Champs-Élysées and the main Marathon is approximately 30 mins to 1 hour away by walking depending on if you stop to take in the sights.   All in all, a lovely little boutique guest house with lots of character, friendly staff and quirky bits. I would"

The entire staff was very friendly, and they were all bi or multi lingual. I stayed in a “cozy” room so it was small but I wasn’t in it very much. The lift is tiny, capacity three people but it’s not the end of the world if you have to let one person go up and wait for it to come back down.  WiFi worked fine, was a little slow once or twice but nothing significant.  Bus and metro options are very nearby and it’s within walking distance of Montmartre, and three of the major train stations. Paris has a fantastic public transportation app so it’s really easy to catch a bus or the metro to the city center, like around the Eiffel Tower. There’s a bakery right around the corner and lots of restaurants nearby as well.  Their early booking discount was phenomenal when I"

That is true.  Naturally things change, but when I looked it up and saw that it was still in existence, read the reviews and saw the rate, I booked it.  I am very happy that I did.  The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the Notre Dame de Lorette metro stop in a non-touristy area of Paris.  If you want to exit your hotel and be among all the tourists and the most popular sights, this might not be for you.  But if you're like me and you want to walk the streets and feel as though you are in a real Parisian neighborhood, I would highly recommend it.  It is a very short walk to the Opera and the stores on Blvd Haussmann, and a slightly longer but still reasonable walk up to Montmartre.  The"
